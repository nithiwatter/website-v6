Applying to Urspace Labs 2020 was such a great decision looking back on it. Being able to learn more about product design and development here has been such a blast and so informational, that it's even inspired me to learn more about product management outside of this fellowship! But to give more context, I'll take you back to March 2020.

## March 2020
I was looking for something to do in the summer. I had plans of course: renew my internship, take a few courses, and maybe start a new initiative or something. But one thing that I had never done was take part in a summer program that wasn't chosen by my parents. I applied to Bluestamp Engineering (HS engineering program), Leangap & LaunchX (entrepreneurship programs for HS students), as well as a few fellowships for MLH, CodeDay, and of course, Urspace.

## May 2020
I had been accepted into Bluestamp, Leangap, and LaunchX, but rejected from MLH & CodeDay (which was super disappointing).
LaunchX was my dream program - I had seen my friends attend and build their own companies and I wanted to do the same! But let's just say the tuition was not friendly. It was around $7,000 for 2 months at the University of Michigan, and they didn't accept my financial aid application. I decided to research more about it and found that LaunchX wasn't as glamorous as it sounded. Students didn't actually dorm at UMich, but at a local college 1 hour from there. Most companies created at LaunchX weren't officially registered, and most died out right after the program ended because of commitment. After this research, I concluded I wasn't attending LaunchX, and to be honest, Leangap and Bluestamp weren't as good but still just as expensive.
After being accepted, Urspace Labs was my choice! But I didn't know what to expect until we started. (I actually applied as a PM fellow as my first choice but was accepted for engineering, but I won't hold that against them ðŸ˜‰)
June-July 2020 - Urspace Labs!

Once we kicked off the program, I knew that this was going to be interesting. Not because I was mostly surrounded by college students (that's pretty normal for me), but the fact that the group was so small, and that there was such attention to detail. I was amazed at how friendly everyone was, and how cool each of my team members were! This program so far has really shown me that it's not an easy process to ideate new product ideas, and gave me the discipline to actually write out technical product specs and system diagrams so we'd stay organized.

## What I've learned so far
I find the way product management and engineering has been presented to me by the Urspace team is so amazing, because it's seeded interest in me to learn more about product. I'm currently taking an online course for product managers, and I've learned a really cool concept about full-stack web applications, and how the client and the server can actually be separated into separate repositories and even deployed on different platforms, and how a REST API can be integrated to facilitate the communication between them. And looking back on LaunchX, I'm so glad I chose Urspace Labs over that. A few of my friends who are in the virtual program are doing things that I'm doing at Urspace Labs, but at a slower pace, lower difficulty, and higher tuition.

I'm so happy to have my amazing team members Nicole, Jasmine, and Rishik to work with for the rest of this fellowship, and we got super lucky having such an awesome mentor like Don to guide us along the way ðŸ˜„
