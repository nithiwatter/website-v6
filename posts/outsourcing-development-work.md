Almost all companies and organizations involve some sort of tech nowadays. Technology is a booming field that is now extremely important in almost all businesses whether it be a restaurant, a nonprofit, or just a general company. From manufacturing to social services, almost all organizations require some sort of tech. Now, if you are starting or a part of an organization that needs to have some software built, it may be tough to do so if none of your team members are technical or have the skills/knowledge to build something like this.

So, a solution to this problem would be outsourcing your development work. Like any scenario, it’s not my place to say whether outsourcing development work is good or bad, but I definitely want to list the pros and cons of this to help those reading evaluate if this would be a good decision for their organization.

**DISCLAIMER:** The pros and cons listed will vary depending on specific circumstances and situations not covered here, so definitely take the time to think about if these points make sense to your circumstances.

-------------------------------

## Pro #1: Outsourcing is temporary and non-binding
A huge benefit of outsourcing development work is the fact that you don’t need to bring anyone onto your team. No need to give out equity/compensation, no onboarding process, no interviews, etc. Simply find a freelancer or a consulting firm and pass on the task to them and get it finished ASAP!

## Pro #2: Quick and easy
Depending on who you’re outsourcing to, most firms and freelancers work very fast. If you do enough research, it’s quite easy to find the right person/organization for the job to help build whatever your organization is seeking.

## Con #1: High budget
Now again, this depends on where you decide to outsource your development work, but a lot of the times the price you need to pay will be really high. If you need a landing page built, it might be a pretty cheap job, but if it’s an actual software application powering your business or an integral engine for your backend, it will no doubt be a high-budget project. One good rule of thumb would be if it’s a simple landing page or website with no functionality, outsourcing is a good idea if there are more important things to do for your organization. But, if it’s an application that powers the core of your operations or an internal tool that your team members need to interact with on a consistent basis, outsourcing may not be the greatest idea, and I’ll explain why soon.

## Con #2: No feedback iteration cycle
Now, what is a feedback iteration cycle? It is basically a cycle of feedback iteration where clients can give feedback on what they would like in the software that they’re outsourcing. If there’s something wrong with the interface or the functionality is a bit different from what they were thinking about, the developers can make those changes. Now, this becomes a big issue when an app is outsourced. At the core of outsourcing development work, it’s all about building the application with no strings attached. Consulting firms and freelancers do not stick with their clients forever, so if there are bugs and issues that come up, it can only be fixed if those firms/freelancers are nice enough to fix them for you.

## Con #3: Hard to understand the codebase returned
The biggest reason why development work should be outsourced is because no one on your team is technical. So, when the project is completed from outsourcing, all of the code built will be returned to you and you will have complete ownership over it. This is exactly what you wanted though right? You got what you wanted and have 100% ownership over it. But, this might pose a potential issue when something goes wrong with the application, because if you can’t understand the code built, then no one else will be able to fix it unless you figure it out on your own.

-------------------------------

Generally, a good consensus for outsourcing is that if you need something small like a landing page or a website built for your organization, outsourcing is a great idea. You can get it built and designed the way you want it while you and your team focuses on the more important operations. In fact, if your organization needs a custom landing page built, check out my consulting business [WebX Consulting](https://webxconsulting.com), where we’ve already served multiple clients, helping them all design, build, and deploy landing pages for their organizations.

In conclusion, outsourcing is a great concept. It helps businesses move faster, and helps compensate for technical skill in certain organizations. The decision of whether you decide to outsource development work or not is a decision that will vary between different scenarios.
