Hackathons are a great way to build something cool whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned programmer.

If you don’t know what a hackathon is, it’s a 24-48 hour competition where competitors ideate, build, and pitch a project underneath a certain theme that organizers set for the entire event. Hackathons are super popular, and it’s now gone international. Especially with the current pandemic, there has been a huge uproar in online hackathons, allowing people from around the world to attend these events as long as they all have internet connection.

Now for people who have attended hackathons before, this may not apply to you. But, for the people who have never attended a hackathon before, I’d love to give you some tips on navigating your first hackathon, what to do and what not to do to make it a great first experience!

## 1. Don’t stay up the entire time
A lot of first-time hackathon go-ers always stay up the whole entire event. Especially if the event is > 24 hours long, you definitely want to get some sleep in the middle of the event. This is a mistake that I and many other people I know made because you feel like you need to optimize every minute. But, not sleeping really takes a toll not just on your health, but your focus nearing the end of the event which is really bad since you need to present to judges and run audits.

**So, make sure you get some sleep, because you’ll need it nearing the end of the event.**

## 2. Spend a lot of time on the presentation
The presentation/pitching part of each hackathon is probably one of the biggest parts of the event that competitors overlook. It’s a hackathon, so you should be focusing on building it and nothing else right? Well, that’s true if that’s all you care about, which is completely fine. But, if you are competing to win, you need to set a good 3-4 hour chunk of time nearing the end of the event to focus on your presentation with your team. Though the project you build is important, the way it is presented to the judges is super important.

Being a judge myself, I can say for sure that we have to watch **a lot** of presentations. I don’t have the attention span to sit and watch boring presentations for 1-2 hours straight, and I’m sure it’s the same story for other judges. But, when I see a presentation that’s well designed, executed, and presented, it catches my eye, and it sinks in my head during the judging process and actually makes their project look better than it actually is.

**The presentation is crucial to winning hackathons, so give you and your team enough time to execute it well.**

## 3. Continue projects after the hackathon
I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen people start their project on an idea and foundation that’s so strong and stable, and yet, never continue their project after the hackathon to make it better. What you have to realize is that 24 hours is not enough time to make something good. At the end of the event, your project will probably suck with a bunch of bugs, vulnerabilities, and missing features. But, if you continue to work on it after the event, it could be a major addition to your portfolio, and maybe even become a startup!

One of my best projects, Ano.js, started from a hackathon that I won back in November 2019, and worked on it for another 5 months after the event had ended. But, if I hadn’t worked on it after the event ended, it would’ve just been another cool project that no one uses.

**Continue projects after the event - that’s what brings the most potential.**

## 4. Enjoy the event
In the end, hackathons are a fun event. You won’t lose anything if you don’t win, a lot of the times there’s no entry fee, and there’s nothing on the line except winning prizes. It’s important to actually enjoy the event, meet new people, attend workshops, learn something new, etc. Don’t just go for the prizes, or the clout you get when winning. Hackathons can bring about amazing opportunities that are completely unrelated to the actual event, so make sure you’re alert for it. For example, I’ve been offered positions at startups, met great people and mentors, and made connections with other competitors and sponsor ambassadors.

**Make sure you enjoy yourself and the event, don’t just focus on winning.**

## Last thoughts
Just be sure to keep in mind that winning or participating in a hackathon is not that big of a deal. Some people like to do it to put something on their resume, but it should be an enjoyable experience. Even though it is considered a competition, the best results come out of it when you don’t treat it as such. Treat it as a fun event to meet new people, learn something new, work on new projects, add to your portfolio, and maybe win something cool :)
