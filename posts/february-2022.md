------------------

February was one of those months that started off slow and calculated, and the rest just sped past me in a blaze. Though in January I was extremely focused on stretching myself, trying new things, and seeking out new experiences, February had a theme of maintenance. Rather than diversifying and intensifying my day-to-day activities, I tried to maintain the workload I had put upon myself in January.

## Professional updates

Looking back, this month I focused more on upskilling myself. Though I‚Äôve always been on my toes, eyes peaked to seize any signs of new opportunities, this month I shifted my focus towards upskilling myself and learning new things.

From a tweet from [Startup Search](https://twitter.com/startupsearch/status/1488936504122646528) by Contrary and a tag from my friend [Matt](https://twitter.com/MattEspoz), I got my hands on [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654). I usually never read (instead I listen to audiobooks), but I figured I‚Äôd challenge myself to read this book this time. It‚Äôs taken me 3 weeks to read 100 pages so far (rip), but the lessons have been mind-blowing. Don Norman takes examples of everyday things (doors, interfaces, fridges), and breaks down the most critical design aspects involved that allow us to consider these items as ‚Äúsimple‚Äù.

Many who know me know that I haven‚Äôt been the biggest advocate of Web3. Seeing unnecessary use cases of this emerging technology coupled with inflated hype from surged VC investment has turned me off anything related to the field. About a week ago, I was waiting for my mom to head out and run some errands, but she had to delay by another hour to take an important phone call. I was left with nothing to do, so I just scrolled around various feeds and emails. I came across an article published by a fellow Edtech Insiders contributor about an [Educator‚Äôs Guide to Web3](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/educators-guide-to-web3-for-absolute?utm_source=url). Reading through it, the concepts covered in this article were interesting. At the same time, I had just recently heard of [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) as a starting point for getting into Web3 development. I had some time, so I figured, why not give it a try? So, for the past few days I‚Äôve been slowly diving into Solidity and building smart contracts through Buildspace. I don‚Äôt quite know what I‚Äôm doing, but each day I start to understand things a little bit more. Though I‚Äôm not ready to fully immerse myself into Web3, I find the technology very innovative and the potential for new ideas is high. Just the other day, I registered my ENS domain, **calixo.eth**, so feel free to send me anything. üòâ

Around the same time as starting in Web3, I started working on a new project. Reminiscing on the excitement I had when I worked on [Recollect](https://myrecollect.com/), a project purely for myself and family, and I was craving that feeling again. Though I won‚Äôt share what the idea is, I will say that it‚Äôs a mobile app, it‚Äôs purely a personal passion project, and the first version is being developed right now. I have no idea where this project will go or how long it will live, but I‚Äôm crossing my fingers in hopes that it can be another proud addition to my portfolio.

My updates haven‚Äôt been all peaches and rainbows, though. I acknowledge that this month hasn‚Äôt been the most successful month in terms of writing. I haven‚Äôt published a single Edtech Insiders article due to consistent publish date postponements. I‚Äôve finalized two articles that I absolutely love, but the editing/publishing processes can be long and tedious. Endless revision cycles and idea changes can push publish dates by weeks and months, but I hope to push this content out early in March. 

My writing activity for my personal blog hasn‚Äôt been too great either. Besides my monthly reflection, I only published 2 blog posts, both of which were posted at the beginning of the month. This doesn‚Äôt mean that I haven‚Äôt been trying. There are a couple drafts that I started that never made it to being published because I tried forcing myself to write. This month, I realized that I write the best when I feel inspired to do so, and that seems to come in waves. I have a list of at least 30 different blog ideas, but I haven‚Äôt found the interest in writing about any of them. Since I haven‚Äôt placed writing as a heavy obligation in my priority list, I‚Äôve resorted to producing content when I feel pulled to do so. Though I‚Äôm a bit disappointed, I‚Äôm curious to observe how this strategy will fare in March.

## Personal updates

I can confidently say that February emphasized personal experiences and development. I had highs, I had lows, and I learned more about myself each and every time.

Let‚Äôs start with a low. Mid-February I received my booster vaccine, and it completely knocked me out. For some reason, I didn‚Äôt expect that I would feel any side effects after receiving my shot, but clearly my arrogance didn‚Äôt match my immune system. I had a major fever the day after, and uncomfortable arm pain for the following 2 days. While it was a pretty miserable time, it was also peaceful. The moment I woke up and felt the massive fever, I called myself off from work, canceled all my meetings, and allowed myself to truly rest. All day, I just watched TV, lounged around on the couch, and scrolled on Instagram. I obviously needed physical rest, but it was also an excuse to give myself mental rest. After I bounced back from the sickness, I could tell my productivity and efficiency had a major boost.

If you‚Äôre on TikTok, you probably know the toxic trait trend (‚ÄúMy toxic trait is that‚Ä¶‚Äù). Well, my toxic trait is that I always say I‚Äôm down to attend meetups and socials, but then I have to cancel when I realize how far the commute is. For my ODET fellowship, they hosted me and a few other fellows a nice dinner in SF, which I had to relocate to Oakland for an easier commute. Though I was able to attend, I didn‚Äôt know that it was hosted at a 21+ bar, and I was rejected from entering the vicinity. I was frustrated at first, but I made the most of the situation and instead treated my mom to a nice dinner in Oakland.

Sometimes, I forget that I‚Äôm still a student. Though I went through January without working on any academic work, my second semester started and my course workload was reset. Due to my flexible academic schedule, I was able to focus and finish 3 of my 5 classes within the first week. Granted, they were easier classes, but it‚Äôs nice to have it off my plate and out of my mind.

Of course, I visited UC Berkeley twice this month and just had a myriad of fun experiences. I spent my first night there, sleeping in my friends‚Äô dorm rooms and sharing a bed. I decided to take my skateboard and ride around the campus at 2:30am in the morning. I attended my first college party and also assisted a drunk friend in leaving said party. We went on late night drives, had late night conversations, and also chased each other around the dorms in the middle of the night for some reason. I always thought a place like UC Berkeley would inspire me from an educational, academic perspective, but instead it‚Äôs the place where I leave behind all common sense and do the craziest things.

Beyond all the fancy, glamorous things, I also took time to clean my room. And I don‚Äôt just mean re-organizing things and vacuuming. I set aside an entire afternoon to clean out my gigantic closets full of random books, games, and gadgets I‚Äôve collected over the past 10 years, making sure to sort everything into bags for donation. I got the chance to rearrange my room to create space for me to truly relax, which has been so helpful that I made a [tweet](https://twitter.com/calixo888/status/1492977547444776961) about it. And perhaps my favorite part of cleaning out my room was re-discovering old toys and books I used to obsess over in my younger years.

Other than that, I did many other things. I served at my church, managing projection and camera directing. I completed my last few college interviews. I forced myself to leave my desk and work at a coffee shop at least once each week. Most importantly, I emphasized my habits and consistently maintained them in my daily routines.

-------------------------------

I‚Äôm happy to say that I am an improved version of who I was in January, rather than a transformed one. Like I said, February had a theme of maintenance, so instead of constantly seeking and trying new things, I stuck to my habits and slowly improved each day. My habits haven‚Äôt quite come to fruition or produced any noticeable results yet, but I can feel that I‚Äôm improving each day that I stick with them.

I also want to put it out there that there‚Äôs more beyond what I wrote about in this post. Though I enjoy producing content and sharing my story, I create clear boundaries between my work/online life and my personal life because I value personal privacy. As much of an advocate as I am for writing and storytelling, I‚Äôve found that some memories are best kept to myself and those I love.
