I’ve never considered myself a skateboarder. I’ve tried skateboarding a couple times in my life, which usually ended up in quitting after a few minutes. I’ve always hated the idea and the feeling of falling, and skateboarding is a perfect way to fall countless times.

Ironically, one of my favorite YouTubers is [Elliot Choy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaQocIkdhh8TIi56LvLoViA), and the most addicting part of his videos was watching him ride his electric skateboard. Living in NYC, he would ride his electric skateboard around the city, going faster than traffic and getting around quickly and efficiently. It was always so fun to watch him ride his board in his videos, and it always lodged the idea of riding an electric skateboard in my mind.

A few weeks ago, I spent the entire day meeting up with various friends around my city, and so I happily subjected myself to walking around and taking the bus. Just as the sun was just setting, I was waiting for the bus when a girl zipped past me on an electric scooter. Though I had my own electric scooter, I didn’t bring it with me. I looked and thought to myself, “Why don’t I have my electric scooter right now? I could be riding it like her instead of waiting for the bus.” But I remembered that the electric scooter was way too heavy to be taken anywhere. It discouraged me a bit, but then an idea popped up. Why don’t I just get myself an electric skateboard?

I thought about it. I never seriously considered getting myself an electric skateboard because I didn’t know how to skateboard. But at the time, I was extremely burnt out of work, and I couldn’t find any motivation to focus on anything. I figured, why not give it a try?

I got home and did my research. Electric skateboards were priced around $400-500. Though I don’t mind spending money, I hate making stupid purchases. After a lot of thought, I decided that if I could commit to learning how to skateboard, I would buy it.

The very next day, I pulled out an old skateboard from my garage, grabbed my helmet, and went out to my local tennis courts. I watched a handful of YouTube videos on how to skateboard, and braced myself. My biggest fear of skateboarding was falling and injuring myself. So before I started, I practiced falling on the floor over and over. Anyone who was watching me probably thought I was crazy.

I stayed out there for an hour straight, trying to learn how to balance and move around on the board. I got a little bit better over the course of that hour, and I was slightly happy about that progress.

That entire experience was terrifying, constantly being in fear of falling and hurting myself. But, I also saw it as a challenge. I saw it as an opportunity to personally upskill myself in ways that had nothing to do with my regular day-to-day work. I actually sensed a bit of motivation to get better. I knew that this was something I wanted to pursue, so I bought an electric skateboard without any hesitation.

Over the next few days while my electric skateboard was being shipped, I went out to the tennis courts every single day and practiced for an hour. I practiced how to balance and move faster, as well as how to fall properly and safely. It was by no means an easy process - I was constantly anxious of falling, but at the end of each session it felt so fulfilling.

When my electric skateboard finally arrived, I continued to practice, getting better and better each day. I rode it around my neighborhood, to nearby coffee shops, and even rode it around UC Berkeley and the city with my friends.

To this day, I’m still riding my electric skateboard and loving it every time. It’s only been 2 weeks since I started, and I definitely can’t consider myself a good skateboarder. But, I’m continuously getting better and enjoying every moment that I’m on the board.



So, why did I even tell this story?

Throughout my experience of learning how to skateboard, it made me realize that skateboarding requires you to embrace failure. Real skateboarders who do fancy tricks or experiment with crazy stuff on their board have such a high level of bravery and a strong willingness to fail. Attempting tricks or even learning the basics of skateboarding require the open-mindedness to embrace failure - the kind of failure that can leave you injured. Embracing that for myself made me realize that I hadn’t truly been embracing failure in my own life. Though I constantly work to improve and push my limits, it was always in a calculated way where I wouldn’t set myself up for progressive failure. Skateboarding taught me to constantly push my comfort zone in ways that I never expected that I could.

Beyond that, this level of involvement in my own personal development made me realize that my priorities have been screwed up this whole time. Though I don’t really create goals for myself, I’ve always had emphasis on career-oriented intentions that constantly reflect on my actions and thoughts. It’s been a great strategy for keeping a growth mindset and constantly improving myself in various skills and aspects. But, since those were my own real pillars of importance in my life, whenever I had free time, I would always resort myself towards progressing myself professionally instead of taking time to rest or improve in the realm of personal development. Going through this experience of learning a new personal skill helped me understand that I need to have personal goals as well, and ensure that I’m improving as a person and not just as an operator or a founder.

I would’ve never thought that something like skateboarding would have such a collateral impact on my self-reflection. At the end of the day, it’s a skill that doesn’t make a huge impact on my life or what I do on a day-to-day basis besides a micro-increase in convenience. But, if little life improvements can have such a broader improvement, isn’t it worth so much more?
