Who likes getting rejected? Raise your hand.

Aha. No one’s raising their hand.

No one likes rejection. You want something, you want it really bad, and it just doesn’t come true. Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it’s humiliating, and overall it just sucks. But, if I’m being honest, I believe that rejection can be a blessing at times. Why? **Because everything happens for a reason.**

Don’t understand what I mean? Let me walk you through some of the rejections I’ve gone through, and the outcome of each of them.

**I was rejected from over 300+ internships.** Throughout 2019 and 2020, I was super dedicated to landing internships in software engineering. I wanted to stamp my career with industry experience and enhance my skills in programming with real world experience. But, it wasn’t an easy task. I filled out over 300 online applications for undergraduate-level software internships, and was rejected from almost all of them. Looking back, I was so lucky to land the internships that I did. 

**Why was this rejection helpful?** It gave me a whole new level of persistence. I could’ve found 10 companies that I **really** wanted to work for, apply to those 10, and save myself a bunch of time and pain. Receiving all of those rejection emails hurt a lot, but it gave me the thick skin that I needed to feel more okay with rejection.

**I was rejected from the CodeDay and MLH 2020 fellowships.** Back in the summer of 2020, I applied for a bunch of summer programs. I applied for LaunchX, Leangap, and Bluestamp Engineering, and was accepted into all of them. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to attend because the tuition was a bit too high, so I turned to fellowships. I applied and was rejected from the advanced tracks in the CodeDay and MLH fellowships, and it hurt, but not as bad as the previous internship rejections.

**Why were these rejections helpful?** If I had been accepted into either of these fellowships, I might have joined, had a great time, and met some really cool people. But, I may not have been able to join the fellowship that I actually did: urspace labs 2020. In this 10-week fellowship, I worked with a team of 3 other product managers, designers, and engineers, and built a product from the ground up with the help of a mentor. That mentor happened to become a long-term advisor, who gave me advice with Hours, my most successful venture. He taught me about different web application infrastructures that gave me the knowledge to actually build Hours as a product.

**I was rejected from Y-Combinator’s S21 batch.** I love Y-Combinator. I may sound like the most typical Silicon Valley founder in the world right now, but I love startups, and there’s no place like Y-Combinator to seek out innovation and massive growth. When I was working on Hours, it was the first time where I felt I had a good shot at actually being accepted. So I worked on my application in the midst of one of the most chaotic phases of Hours’s lifetime as a solo venture, and eventually got rejected. The actual rejection hurt a bit, but what hurt more was that I was turned away without an interview. Two people I knew received interviews and were rejected from those, but it left me in a state of confusion when my startup was at a validated growth stage when they merely had an idea.

**Why was this rejection helpful?** First off, [Hours got acquired](https://www.calix.dev/blog/hours-acquired-by-fiveable). Second, I wasn’t ready to be a YC founder. Looking back, I know now that at such a young age, I wasn’t ready to commit long-term to a startup that had a high chance of failing if we didn’t exit. The network you’re surrounded by and the investments being made into your company at YC were exactly the resources that many startups need, but those were also the things that held you, the founder, liable for sticking with your venture and turning it into a success story.

**I was rejected from zFellows.** If you don’t know, zFellows is a very fast-paced, prestigious fellowship for young founders. Think of it as a mini Thiel Fellowship. I had found this program through someone I knew in my On Deck Catalyst cohort, and the more I read into it, I absolutely loved it. I worked on my application, submitted it, and got an interview. I did very well on my interview, anticipated a possible chance of success, and then got rejected. It sucked and hurt a lot, but what stung more was seeing those around me get accepted into the exact cohort I was applying for - people that I humbly thought I had a better chance then.

**Why was this rejection helpful?** The venture idea that I was applying with turned out to be a flop. Many apply to this fellowship with ideas to validate and not necessarily with a developed product. I had a developed product that I was validating, and it ended up flopping from a financial perspective before ever coming out of stealth. As much as I wanted the name credibility and small but hefty investment from the fellowship, I’m glad to be at the front of the waiting list, ready to have another chance to join the next cohort with a better idea.

Rejections still suck. But, if you look on the bright side and stay positive, you may be able to see quite a few benefits from those heavy rejections that only protrude regret and sadness. I’ve been rejected from so many more things than the ones that I just listed, but the amount of rejections you have is irrelevant. It’s all about how you take it and come back stronger.

**I believe that our pain is never wasted, and if you take it the right way, it can turn into a blessing.**
