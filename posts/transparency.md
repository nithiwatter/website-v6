I’m pretty transparent. Obviously, I have my boundaries. I don’t share very personal info that may put my family and I in physical or legal trouble, especially not online. But in terms of my stories, experiences, feelings, thoughts, and ideas, I’m open with them all.

**But, why?** 

For me, I’m not transparent because of the benefits it provides, though it is very helpful. I’m happy to open up about my past experiences and mistakes because I’m genuinely passionate about sharing my journey. Even if some moments throughout my story are embarrassing or controversial, I share it. There will be people who resonate with my story and those who don’t - the human race has and always will be diverse in terms of beliefs and knowledge.

I love to encourage others to be more transparent with their stories as well. But from a logical perspective, **why is being transparent important?**

**Being transparent shows who you really are.** If you’re transparent with your backstory, beliefs, and opinions, it will allow others to learn who you are on a deeper level than what they may already know. Your work, achievements, and curated personality is what many have seen before, but they might not know about your religious stance, your rough childhood, or your emotional stance. 

For example, I’m a Christian. My family and I have grown up Christian, but it’s not a part of me many people know. It’s a huge part of my life, and I’m not only open to being transparent about it, but I’m driven to share the blessings I’ve received with others.

**Being transparent shows authenticity.** Opening up about who you really are evokes a sense of trust in others. No one fully trusts those who lie frequently, or hide parts of their personality. Being transparent makes you more authentic, for the more others know about you the more trustworthy you are.

**Being transparent provides accountability.** If you’re transparent with your goals, others knowing about it will provide accountability to stick with them. If you’re transparent with your past mistakes, those who indulge in your story will hold you accountable for those mistakes, but not always in a bad way. Staying accountable for your mistakes can help you ensure you don’t mess up again.

In the end, transparency is a choice. You should never be open with your life to the point where you’ll put you and those around you in danger, but being transparent is beneficial for everyone. Allowing others to learn from your own experiences and mistakes can be very valuable to them, and sometimes a little kindness goes a long way.
