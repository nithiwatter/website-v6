I think we can all agree that attention is nice. Though some are uncomfortable with it and prefer it less than others, attention, in a general sense, feels good. Getting recognized for your achievements, receiving praise for your hard work, and having people spend their precious time to listen, look, read, and learn about **you**.

I’m definitely no exception.

Over the last 2 years of learning about computer science, building different software projects, and extending far past my comfort zone, I’ve arrived at a place I’ve never dreamed of - building applications and companies that actually have impact.

Though these applications and companies don’t actually impact a huge amount of people, any achievement you possess is exponentially magnified when you factor in age.

I’m lucky to have gotten my start in my freshman year of high school. That might be extremely early for some, and late for others. But because of this, my achievements have gathered a bit of attention.

This resulted in me getting so many opportunities to garner attention. I was able to jump on podcasts, get interviewed for articles, speak at conferences, and much more.

Now, this is great right? Who doesn’t like to talk about themself? I would be a liar if I said I didn’t, and I love being upfront. And in the beginning, I absolutely loved being a podcast guest, speaking at events, and getting praised for my work.

But just recently, I’ve noticed how shallow all of this is. Let me explain.

I was lucky enough to record a podcast episode a couple days before this post was published, and it was great! I loved the podcast, the host was super nice, welcoming, and easy to talk to, and we got to talk about my new projects and ideas.

But, just a couple of hours after finishing the recording, I saw on the podcast’s Instagram story that they were already promoting the next 2 guests that would record their episode just 2 days after mine.

Then it hit me: I’m not that special. Though every podcast is different, their goal is always to garner an audience, and sometimes that process is reliant on the hunger for attention from relatively successful people. This principle is the same for every media outlet, whether it be a podcast, a newspaper, an event, or an article publication.

So what did I learn from all of this? **I'm not that special.**

Haha I’m kidding! Sorta.

Everyone’s special. But in the context of media, press, and attention, you’re not that special. Everyone is looking out for their own interests, dreams, goals, and passions. Those closest to you value a lot, but those simply stumbling across a podcast or article written about you don’t.

You need to execute on your own goals for you and those closest to you, not the random people around the world who don’t care about what you’re doing. If you’re a nonprofit, impact those who you target in the best possible manner. If you’re a company or a startup, solve an issue in your customer’s lives and build a business off of it.

But all in all, you need to stay true to yourself, and not let your actions be fueled by something as shallow as attention.
