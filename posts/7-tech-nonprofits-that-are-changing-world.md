According to the founder of Fast Forward, a nonprofit accelerator in the Bay Area, the number of new tech nonprofits is increasing by over 30% every year.

Similar to tech startups, nonprofits are able to take advantage of the constantly evolving world of technology. Cloud computing, omnipresent mobile devices, and social media, just to name a few factors, make it incredibly easy for organizations to benefit the world through tech. There are countless amazing tech nonprofits, but here are just a few that you should know about.

The Center for Democracy and Technology strives to promote democratic values and ensure that laws are encouraging people to use technology for the betterment of the world. They aim to decrease government censorship and surveillance while simultaneously protecting the rights and privacy of citizens. In the midst of a digital revolution, it’s easy to lose sight of individual rights, but it’s crucial to protect them in order to use technology ethically.

The most critical aspect of saving lives after humanitarian crises such as hurricanes and typhoons is to collect reliable information. However, understanding the needs of the population is often neglected due to the need to quickly gather and analyze this information. KoBo Toolbox works on developing an open-source suite of data collection tools that address this issue. Their software is entirely free and is typically used by professionals addressing crises and researchers in developing countries. With the software that KoBo Toolbox provides, it’s possible to collect crucial data safely, quickly, and ethically.

Technology is developing faster than ever, and with this comes the ubiquity of computers and the importance of learning how to use them. However, many children around the world don’t have access to computers and are therefore unable to explore the endless possibilities of digital technology. One Laptop Per Child attempts to remedy this by producing low-cost, powerful, and ecological laptops for underprivileged children living in less affluent communities. By opening infinite doors for countless children, One Laptop Per Child works toward a more advanced and equitable future.

[**NPower**](https://www.npower.org/)
In the present day, over 70% of jobs require some sort of digital or technological skill, but the job market has fallen behind. Out of the 6 million jobs that require technological prowess, only 3.2 million people are equipped with the skills necessary for them. NPower focuses on training military veterans and young adults so that they can succeed in the digital economy. They envision a future in which gender, race, and socioeconomic status don’t hold people back from pursuing prosperous careers.

[**Code.org**](https://code.org/)
The vast majority of students who go through the K-12 public education system take a set of common STEM subjects, such as algebra, chemistry, and biology. However, despite the exponential advancement of technology in recent years, many students don’t have the opportunity to study computer science before college. Code.org aims to make computer science part of the core K-12 curriculum so that students are better equipped for their future in such a tech-dominated society. So far, they’ve impacted tens of millions of students and teachers with their programs.

[**Girls Who Code**](https://girlswhocode.com/)
In 1995, 37% of engineers were females. Since then, this number has dropped to an astounding 24%, and will continue to decline unless drastic changes are made. Similar to Code.org, Girls Who Code aims to increase students’ access to coding-related opportunities, particularly girls and other underrepresented minorities. By influencing girls ages 13-17, Girls Who Code aims to expose girls to the world of programming while they’re still young and change the image of what a programmer is, thereby closing the gender gap.

Looking at all these amazing missions, it’s clear that rapidly advancing technology can be used for so much more than starting enormous corporations and making billions of dollars. With tech becoming so prevalent in the modern day, it’s crucial that we use it not just to convenience ourselves, but also to better society.
