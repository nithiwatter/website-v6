It’s official - **Hours has been acquired by Fiveable.**

After almost 6 weeks of negotiating, planning, and due-diligence, the acquisition offer presented to me has closed once and for all.

Though it’s really exciting news, I’m not going to talk about the specifics of the acquisition - you can read about that on Fiveable’s blog [here](https://hi.fiveable.me/post/fiveable-acquires-hours-to-bring-virtual-study-rooms-to-students).

**Instead, I want to talk about the journey of this acquisition, from start to finish.**

### Feb 8 &#8212; Lead Generated

Back in February, we were doing a lot of cold emailing. We were emailing teachers from all around California, seeing if any of them would be willing to recommend Hours to their students, and many of them did!

One particular teacher, who shall remain unnamed, was partnered with Fiveable, and recommended that I reach out to them for a potential partnership. And with that suggestion, I did exactly that. I sent over an email to Amanda, the CEO of Fiveable, and waited for a response.

### Feb 23 &#8212; First Call

After hearing back from Amanda a couple weeks after sending my introduction, we were able to hop on a call. I felt so privileged to be able to pitch my project to such a notable entrepreneur, and after demoing the product and sharing my story, it felt so good to hear that she was impressed with my work.

After the call, there were so many questions. I had brought up an idea of a partnership between Hours and Fiveable, but nothing more. I was unsure of where it would take us, so all I could do was wait.

### Mar 18 &#8212; Second Call

A long time wait, but finally another step forward. This time, I had a call with Dylan, the Head of Product at Fiveable. 

We talked through many things - the origin of Hours, our current impact and metrics, and some casual back-and-forth conversation about career paths in general. And yet again, it felt so good to hear that my work with Hours was notable from a very experienced veteran in the world of product and engineering.

I walked away from this call optimistic about the potential between Hours and Fiveable, but still had no idea what the possibilities could be.

### Mar 25 &#8212; The Offer

Looking back, I would have never expected this.

I had gotten an unusually fast reply from my last call with Dylan, and was offered another call with Amanda. I wasn’t informed what the call would be about, but I was excited to see what would happen.

All I can remember is talking about the potential that Hours and Fiveable could have together, and how we could collaborate. I was highly doubtful of what could sprout between us because of the difference in scale - we had hundreds of users and they had hundreds of thousands. Why would they possibly want to work with us?

And then, the offer was made.

**“We would like to acquire Hours.”**

Hold up. Are you kidding me?! The fact that an established, reputable startup wanted to acquire a project built by a high school student was unreal.

To be more specific, it was an acquisition in which Hours would join Fiveable to be grown into something more than it currently was. A crucial detail was for me to join their team to achieve just that, for the magic of Hours doesn’t just come from the product, but the creator. Hours truly is the epitome of “built by students, for students”.

My mind was racing after the call. I was unsure of what I should do, if I was ready for something like this, if it was worth it, and even why they were even interested in acquiring Hours.

Despite not having a clear idea of what my decision would be, I decided to move forward with next steps: due-diligence.

### Mar 30 - Apr 22 &#8212; Due-Diligence

It’s one thing to look at a product and say, “I think that would be a good asset to buy.” But then comes the part where you need to take it apart, look inside, and look for any weakness possible.

What’s it built with? How did you structure it? What are the metrics? How’s the retention?

Question after question came rolling in, and I needed to assure the Fiveable leadership members that this could be a plausible transaction.

If you didn’t know already, I’m an overthinker. I was sweating bullets for these 2 weeks wondering if they were going to change their mind at any point in time. No one could say anything to give me any sort of affirmation, not even Fiveable themself.

It was tough to have so much waiting time between due-diligence meetings, not understanding what they truly thought of Hours, and what kind of future they saw for it. All throughout this process, it was so hard to keep seeing my peers build up their startups and grow them without worry, while I kept waiting for an acquisition offer that I was still unsure of to solidify.

### Apr 23 &#8212; First Decision

Finally, after 3 weeks, a contract appeared. 

Well, not 1 contract. **5 contracts.**

Amanda hopped on a call with me to explain the situation. Because I was a minor, there were a lot of legal issues and liabilities that came along with that, and they needed to make sure they were protecting themselves to not jeopardize themselves in the future.

Though it was completely valid of Fiveable to take these precautions, the terms of this deal were completely flipped upside down, in a way that my family and I couldn’t accept. We had to re-negotiate these terms with solid contracts instead of our original letter of intent, so not only was it going to be harder than normal, but our lawyer fees were about to skyrocket.

### Apr 24-May 2 &#8212; Re-negotiation

Toughest part, hands down. I had never negotiated on something this big in my life, so I was super stressed. I was impatient, frustrated, and scared that all of this time and effort on both parties was all for nothing.

Everything was changing. Terms were re-negotiated. Guidelines were added and removed. This deal was so close, yet so far. I had contracts in my hand, but yet I couldn’t sign them.

### May 3 &#8212; Closing

Finally. After all the hurdles and all the obstacles, I had 5 contracts in front of me, ready to be signed. And let me tell you, it felt **so** good to write the last signature on the last document. 

So much weight was released off my shoulders. I had experienced insane amounts of happiness, sadness, anxiety, stress, and frustration throughout the acquisition process, and it finally felt like I could breathe again.

Though I knew that it was going to be a stressful week of integration and preparation for launch on behalf of Fiveable, I was optimistic for the future.

## Taking a step back

Before this acquisition, there were so many unknowns. I didn’t know if it was possible to grow Hours into the gigantic platform that I had envisioned, or if I had the skills and knowledge to execute on my future vision for Hours. At the end of the day, I’m just a 16-year-old kid with big dreams and work ethic. Working with Fiveable on this provides so many resources to actually take this vision and turn it into a reality, all while learning from some of the smartest minds in edtech.

Throughout this whole acquisition, I learned something very important: **patience.** I’m not the most patient person in the world, and the mind of any 16-year-old kid will be immature to some degree. It was hard to have so much waiting time between hearing back from lawyers, redlining documents, and generally just pushing back on terms that might cause the entire deal to break.

I was able to learn that everything always tends to work out. Though you may really want results now, we all must just stay patient and faithful that things will work out. And if they don’t work out, it just means that something even better is coming in the future.

It’s easy to say that this truly has changed my life. Despite all the money, clout, and credibility that’s come out of this, my perspectives have completely changed in the best way possible, and I’ve learned things that many people don’t get to learn in their entire lifetime. I’m so grateful to God for this opportunity, and I will not let it go to waste.

## Acknowledgements

I could’ve never done this alone. So many people played a part in this acquisition, all of which with my best interest in mind, so I wanted to give them a huge shoutout.

First and foremost, I want to thank my parents, specifically my mom. She helped me read every single contract, send every email, and analyzed every situation. She taught me about legal transactions, mitigating risk, trade-offs, negotiation, and possibly every single aspect of this acquisition that I was unfamiliar with. And all of this without asking for anything in return - something only family would do.

I also want to pay a huge thanks to Amanda, and the whole Fiveable team. They were super supportive, empathetic, and kind towards me during this whole operation. Amanda was very sympathetic to how a big decision like this could affect someone that’s still pretty young, so she always held my best interest in mind and made everything as easy as possible.

Finally, I want to thank my mentors and advisors: Vincenzo Marcella, Don Morton and James Bender. As very highly-accomplished entrepreneurs/engineers who’ve been in my shoes before, their advice and guidance was priceless, and it really helped shape my perspective of this acquisition as a whole.

There were so many other people that played a huge part in this acquisition, so I thank you all! This was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I’m so grateful that I was lucky enough to experience it.
