Sometimes, great opportunities come at bad times. As much as I wish it weren’t true, that’s just the way things work out occasionally.

To illustrate this, here’s a story of why I turned down a Y Combinator (YC) startup position.

It was with a startup that will remain unnamed that was accepted into the YC S21 batch, backed by YC partners who were the CEOs at Twitch and Yahoo. In just 5 months, they’d grown to 100,000 daily active users, partnered with tens of major social media influencers, and had gone hugely viral on Instagram/TikTok.

They had scouted me out and were impressed with my work with Hours, as well as my journey as a whole, and they were interested in making me their very first technical hire on a part-time or full-time basis with employee benefits and stock options.

Pretty much a dream job for any student interested in startups and software.

So, why did I turn it down?

**The short answer is I was legally bound to turn it down.**

But, there’s a longer story behind it.

I received an email from the co-founder of the startup on April 29, asking for a call. It was such a pleasant surprise to receive it because 1) I had heard of their startup before and really resonated with their mission and product because it flowed so closely to what I had worked on before.

The only issue was… I was in the middle of a production issue meltdown. Things were on fire, users were complaining, so that entire email and proposition completely slipped my mind.

When I finally decided to revisit the email 2 days later, there was another dilemma. I was in the final stages of the Hours x Fiveable acquisition, and had a lot to stress about. I ended up scheduling the call for a week in advance to ensure that I would be able to handle one thing at a time.

By May 3, the acquisition was closed. Everyone was celebrating, yet scrambling to prep Hours for a launch. It was only then I realized that I had signed myself onto a non-compete - a term that would pretty much fully prohibit me from working with this startup.

Fast-forward to May 8, I was on a call with 2 of their co-founders. The news about the acquisition was made public the day before, and apparently they had found out before the call even started. You can probably infer what the atmosphere was: awkward.

I ended up having to turn down the offer. Though it was an amazing opportunity, and I had always wanted to join YC, I couldn’t put my recent acquisition deal in jeopardy because I decided to break a core term in the agreements. Though technically in California (where I'm based) non-competes aren't legally binding, integrity is an important value to hold.

It all came down to what I wanted. Even though I've always wanted to join YC, I'd rather join as a founder, not an employee. 

The moral of the story is, **sometimes good opportunities come at inconvenient times.** Though this was an example of that, I'm blessed enough to have what I have, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
