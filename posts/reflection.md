A couple days ago it was Independence Day, I got some time to hang out with friends and family in light of such a memorable day. It was a much needed break from stress and worries of work to spend some time and celebrate with those I care about. With that time, I got some time to ideate new concepts, which ended up turning into a deeper reflection.

I was playing tennis with a good friend - we’ll call him Jason. To be honest, we talk more than we actually play, but luckily those conversations are filled with interesting stories, past experiences, and mutual laughter. 

At one point, we hopped on the topic of teachers, and what stories we have from being back in elementary school. Both of us had quite a range of different anecdotes to talk about, but then I asked the question, “What do you think our elementary school teachers would think of us if they saw where we are today?” This question was open to be repurposed for many other people as well: past friends, classmates, and maybe even crushes.

In hindsight, we didn’t really share any insightful thoughts at the moment. As I took more time to think about it, it boiled down to reflection. “Am I proud of who I am today, with the context of who I was many years ago?”

I have my fair share of people I can use for my reflection. To keep things simple: 1 teacher, 1 friend, 1 crush.

In 5th grade, I had this teacher I didn’t like - we’ll call him Mr. Wartborgen (no joke, that was similar to his actual name). He was mean, strict, and slightly sexist towards all of the girls. He made me write letters to my parents when I forgot my homework, rewrite those letters 3-4 times, and even made me stay after class during recess because I didn’t write the date on my science notes (I actually did, he just didn’t see it). 

In 4th grade, I had the only best friend I’ve ever had during my time in school - we’ll call him Ryan. You wouldn’t think we were best friends because we didn’t talk much, but we did everything together. We had 3 different recesses back then, and we spent all of them doing our homework in advance or folding origami. We had a few good memories together, but it never went beyond that. We only became friends in the second half of the school year, and after the semester ended I had to attend another school. To this day, we haven’t seen or spoken to each other even though we probably live within 15 minutes of the other.

In 10th grade, I had a crush - we’ll call her Katie. We met at a coding club that I was pretty active in, and we started volunteering together. I tried to spend as much time with her as possible, whether it was working on similar projects or peer tutoring on a weekly basis. Our dynamic was short-lived, ending after 6 months because I got rejected. It hurt - it happened right before a family vacation and Christmas, and I couldn’t quite enjoy those events as much as I would’ve wanted to.

Why do I bring these people up? These are all people that hold memories in my mind from years prior. More importantly, the Calix that they knew was much different from who I am today. My experiences in computer science, public speaking, and entrepreneurship have shaped what I know, what I do, and how I interact with others.

So, coming back to the reflection question: “Am I proud of who I am today, with the context of who I was many years ago?”

For me, **absolutely.**

Mr. Wartborgen only knew me as a shy, quiet student. Ryan only knew me as a good, loyal friend. Katie only knew me as a high schooler that liked computer science. Some of these qualities still suit me today, and some don’t. At the end of the day, I’m so much more than any of these three labels.

Why did I even do this reflection? Because it illustrates my growth as a person. You could take almost anyone, ask them to do this reflection, and see their growth over time whether it be in maturity, knowledge, skills, etc.

Beyond that, it can be applied to other parts of our lives. Sometimes your growth feels stagnant even when you feel like you’re doing all the right things. Being able to reflect on your growth over time with as little bias as possible can really contextualize your situation, and allow you to see the full picture. Progress will always look small when you visualize it on a day-to-day basis. But, if you take a step back and see the full picture over months and years, even micro-increments of improvements on a consistent basis equate to huge growth.

Now, it’s your turn. Reflect on your life and appreciate all the progress you’ve made. Every time you feel stagnant, lost, or unproductive, do this exercise. It’s easy to miss the big picture when we live and work on a day-to-day basis, so making sure that you can zoom out and appreciate all you’ve accomplished thus far will be a life-long skill.
