A couple days ago, I spoke in public for the first time in 2-3 years.

It’s been so long because of the COVID pandemic, with everything being locked down. All the places I used to speak at were gone, and COVID hit just when I started my journey in entrepreneurship. Though I’m no stranger to public speaking, it sure was nerve wracking. Here’s the context.

I was working on a stealth venture aimed at the Christian community, and after speaking with my youth pastor, he invited me to speak to the whole youth group at my church. It was an opportunity that I accepted almost immediately.

My job was simple: speak for 5 minutes about my project, why it works, and why it would be helpful for everyone in the room. But, there were 2 factors that really had me nervous.

My church invests a lot of money into having an amazing venue and experience for everyone who visits, and it shows. The youth group has a separate auditorium, with vertically-leveled seating, a stage, lights, speakers, soundboards, and a ton of other things. This kind of environment is such a nice one to be in, but it made it infinitely scarier when you were actually speaking, or running the show.

Not only was the environment scary, but so were the people. Being homeschooled, I’ve never been super exposed to regular high school culture. So to me, every single person in my youth group looked like a cool, popular, intimidating high school student. If I’m being honest, this scared the heck out of me.

So I prepared a bunch. On the day I had to speak, I practiced my speech 10+ times, and each time took around 5-6 minutes. I was surprised I hadn’t lost my voice by the time I was actually on the stage.

And…. it went well! Not only was it not as scary as I thought it would be, but the audience was super nice and supportive. I didn’t stutter too much, I remembered my points, and I caught it all on camera. I felt so glad I stuck with it after I finished, and wouldn’t trade it for any other outcome.

To be honest, there’s no “moral of the story” or “lesson to take away”. Though I’ve accomplished quite a bit and done public speaking in the past, I still got really nervous and scared, and that’s okay. I could’ve turned down the opportunity at any point and still been perfectly fine without speaking, but the true benefit didn’t really come from the publicity. 

**What really mattered was sticking to my word, and facing my fears anyways.**
