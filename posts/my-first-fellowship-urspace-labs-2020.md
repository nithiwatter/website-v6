On June 13, 2020, I committed 10 weeks of my life to a summer fellowship called [urspace labs](https://labs.urspace.io/), led by [urspace](https://urspace.io/).

The backstory behind this decision was actually quite an interesting one, and I wrote about it here, but here’s a few things I learned over those 10 weeks!

--------------------------------------------

## It’s not just what you’re learning, but who you’re learning with
I noticed pretty early in the fellowship that I was not in the same age group as my peers. My peers were mostly upperclassmen in undergrad, new grads, with a few being rising freshmen in college. This was not the first time I had been in an environment where everyone else was much older than me, but because this cohort was so small and tight-knit, it was definitely a different experience.

Surprisingly, I didn’t feel intimidated or scared at all. Everyone was so nice and welcoming, and we had frequent coffee chats with each where we could discuss our team’s progress throughout the program and keep in touch.

This welcoming environment made it super enjoyable to learn more about product design/development. Whether it was through casual chats or weekly lectures, this environment was such an amazing experience that might not be replicated in the second iteration of this fellowship.

**Takeaway:** A bit cliche, but it’s not just what you know, but who you know, and who you’re with.

--------------------------------------------

## You don’t always need to give off an intimidating, professional attitude
Each team in the fellowship was given a mentor, which was a co-founder of urspace. It was such an amazing experience, because each co-founder was so accomplished, yet so young. They were all in their young-20s with full careers in product, design, or engineering started, all studying/graduating from prestigious schools. And yet, with all that professional backing, they were the easiest and nicest people you could ever talk with! Shoutout to [Don Morton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-morton/), [Emily Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilychungj/), [Vanessa Qin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessaqin/), and [Alex Nakagawa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexnakagawa/) for being incredible mentors!

I met students from Berkeley Haas, UCLA, USC, Cornell, Dartmouth, etc. People from all these amazing schools that me and all my peers gawk at and try to work towards through our HS careers I was able to talk to at any time! And yet, not one person throughout the entire program was elitist or arrogant, and never once disrespectful. Everyone was eager to learn and didn’t use their school or past accomplishments to assert dominance or brag at all.

**Takeaway:** Don’t try to be intimidating or arrogant no matter how accomplished you are, and don’t be scared of those who are.

--------------------------------------------

## Product design comes before product development
More on the technical side, it was surprising how much time we spent not building the product, but instead planning, designing, researching, and iterating. In the 10-week program, we spent over half of it just figuring out the idea, and the rest actually working to build it.
I very much have an engineering mindset, where if I’m not building something I don’t feel like I’m very productive. Going through this kind of process was a struggle to say the least, but opened my eyes to why we focus so much on product ideation/design. If you don’t have a clear idea of what your product is, why it exists, and if people actually want it is super important, and my mentor, Don, can attest to the point that I had wanted to get better at this aspect of building a product from the start.

**Takeaway:** You need to understand your product front-to-back before you write one line of code.

--------------------------------------------

In the end, I’m so grateful for the opportunity to be a fellow for urspace labs 2020, it was definitely an experience. I got to learn so much, meet so many new and awesome people, and even continued my project on the side from the program! Shoutout to my amazing team from the program: [Nicole Chui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolechui/) (PM), [Jasmine Yee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-yee/) (Design), [Rishik Lad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rlad/) (Engineering), as well as our amazing mentor [Don Morton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-morton/)!
