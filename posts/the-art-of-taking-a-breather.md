**I get emotional sometimes.**

For those who know me, I try to always be as upbeat and funny as possible. I don’t take things too seriously, and like to enjoy things.

But sometimes, life gets stressful. Things happen that aren’t in my favor, and that can trigger a variety of emotions, whether that means anger, sadness, or frustration. Heck, I’m kinda angry as I write this post.

I think something very valuable that I’ve learned is the art of “taking a breather”.

**Emotions are powerful.**

The right emotions can give you the motivation and drive to achieve your goals, do great things, and inspire others. But negative emotions can mess with you, throw you off course, and hurt a lot.

I’m no psychology-expert, or health and wellness enthusiast. I can’t tell you exactly how to help with these emotions, but I can tell you about how it can affect you in your work, and how to “take a breather”.

**Negative emotions can mess with your mind.** 

They can tarnish your focus. They can throw you off track. And when all that happens, you can’t be as productive as you can be if you were in a better state. And relating to people who are sucked into “unhealthy productivity” and feel the need to be productive all the time, you may be feeling these emotions but choose to push through it because you “must be productive”.

I’ve never been the most patient person in the world. I like to move fast, make progress fast, get results fast, and never wait. I like to take action as early as possible, and see results. So, it was never natural for me to take a break when my emotions started to get the better of me.

**What I’ve learned is to take these situations as logically as possible.**

It’s clear that when we’re thrown off by negative emotions, we’re not able to perform at our peak. We can’t think as clearly, process things as fast, or focus as well as when we’re in a happy or neutral state. Basically, we can’t work as efficiently as before.

With that in mind, we can bring up the question, “is this even worth it?” Is it worth it to force myself to work while in a negative state where I can’t work as efficiently, and might drive my mental state into a worse position than it already is? Hopefully, your answer to that question should be no.

**The next thing to do is to “take a breather”.**

Do something else. Distract yourself. Healthily take out your emotions. For me, I would always go out and play tennis when I feel stressed, overwhelmed, or angry. It’s good exercise, it takes my mind off whatever’s bothering me, and helps me collect my thoughts.

Taking these kinds of breaks is really important to sustain yourself, and to not burnout. Burnout comes up much more frequently and hits much harder when it’s fueled by negative emotions. Putting things in perspective and not forcing yourself on things that will ultimately put you in a worse position not only takes awareness - it takes discipline.

And that’s the art of “taking a breather”! Sometimes tough situations have simple solutions - it just takes a little bit of awareness. 

**Emotions are a powerful thing, and it’s important to know how to not only deal with them, but how to react to them.**
