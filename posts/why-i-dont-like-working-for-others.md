I know, it sounds bad. Just let me explain.

To start, **there's nothing wrong with working for other people.** In fact, it's crucial to businesses and corporations to fill their team with skilled people to thrive.

But, it's just not for me, and here's why.

**TLDR; I don't like trading my time and effort towards someone else's value.** 

I enjoy working on projects because they're something that make me proud. I love seeing other people use what I've built, especially when I've poured a lot of time and effort into it. My projects are things that I've ideated, built, maintained, and **own.** 

But, when I'm working for something else, it's not quite the same. I'm given an idea that's already been validated, and possibly something that I'm not really super passionate for. I pour my time and energy into this job, but none if it belongs to me. The work I produce has no benefit to me - it's simply trading my time, effort, and expertise for money. Money is important, don't get me wrong. But especially when I'm at a stage in my life where I don't need to sustain myself, my time and energy is much more important. 

I do agree - it's pretty arrogant to trash-talk working for other people without having the experience to back it up. Though it's illegal for minors to work a full-time job, but I do have a similar experience.

Back in October 2020, I accepted a contract project with a consulting firm who was working with a psychiatric center. The details of this project will be relatively generic because my NDA restrictions, but the project was to build a web-based video conferencing platform for the psychiatric staff and their patients. Basically, a custom version of Google Meet.

This was a really daunting project. Real-time video communication is pretty complex with a lot of caveats. No third-party APIs or packages were allowed to be used - everything had to be from scratch. Not to mention, I only had 3 months to build this from start to finish. 

You'd think that the techincal part of this project would be the hardest part, but interestingly not. The techincal aspect was difficult, don't get me wrong. But finding the motivation and passion to actually pour my time and energy into this project was really difficult.

I struggled to commit to this contract project because it wasn't for me. I was pouring my time and energy into something that I would have no ownership for. I had no creative freedom - simply build, get feedback, and iterate. No new ideas, no custom iterations, no passion. I wasn't even allowed to display this project on my portfolio because of privacy reasons. In the end, all of this work was going to be put towards someone else's value, so I dropped the project.

To wrap this all up, I don't like trading my time and effort towards someone else's value. As a disclaimer, this shouldn't change your perspective on working for others, or influence you in any way that may be against your own personal opinions. This is simply how I feel about working for others, and wanted to share my perspective in hopes that similar people would resonate with me.
