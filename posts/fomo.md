**FO·MO** (/ˈfōmō/): anxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on social media.

That’s what I was feeling when I saw all my friends posting their flights and meetups at [ETH Denver](https://www.ethdenver.com/). Being uninterested in Web 3.0, I wasn’t even a good candidate to participate at this event. And yet, my mind raced with regretful thoughts of not attending or even being interested in the field. My relaxing weekend activities suddenly felt unproductive and useless.

----------------------------------

I’m no stranger to FOMO. It’s been a common, consistent feeling that I’ve had for quite some time, especially after [exiting my last venture](https://www.calix.dev/blog/hours-acquired-by-fiveable). While I was buried deep in my pursuits for growing my product, it was hard to pay attention to what anyone else was doing. After exiting, I found myself giving more attention to those around me and spending time reading about other people’s success. Communities like Tech Twitter became a pigeonhole full of hype and FOMO, even more so for those who exist in a community full of young teen founders and entrepreneurs. I’ve seen many people in my circle get into web3 and crypto, work on their own startups, and consistently maximize their time towards exponential career growth.

When FOMO hits, it can be the worst feeling ever. Your own priorities can feel insignificant, and doubt can arise in the areas you felt so confident in. You can question the direction you’re heading in, and possibly make some rash decisions. FOMO can rule out reason and why you’re in the situation you’re in, and why you’ve intentionally put yourself there.

My solution to FOMO has been this: stop what I’m doing, take a few deep breaths, and think logically. What am I really missing out on? Am I really missing out on that much? Is this FOMO real or has it spurred up in the heat of the moment?

For example, I’ve felt FOMO for not delving into web3 and crypto, as well as not working on a startup right now. When I start to think logically, I remember why I haven’t followed in pursuit of these things. I haven’t immersed myself in web3 because I’ve decided to specialize in fields I’m passionate about such as education technology and alternative education. I haven’t been working on a startup because I know that right now isn’t a great time for me personally. I’m giving myself the opportunity to enjoy special life milestones like my high school graduation and senior summer, while also giving myself space to become a better operator through work experience.

FOMO isn’t just centered around career events - it’s a social construct too. A couple weeks ago, I had a conversation with my friend Marina, a freshman at UC Berkeley. While chatting casually, the topic of FOMO popped up, and she talked through her experience combatting it as a new college student. In her first semester, she dealt with massive amounts of FOMO because our friend group was constantly mingling and having fun. In order to join in on all the fun, it was impossible to keep a normal work or sleep schedule. 

“In my first semester, I was trying so hard to experience all of the fun memories they were making, but it cost me my sleep and grades. At some point, FOMO is too high maintenance - you can miss out on important aspects of your life. At the end of the day, you can’t have everything seem special. Back when I kept involving myself in everything, I had so many memories that these trips and social events became diluted. Now, I handpick the memories I decide to create, which makes them all very special to me.”

----------------------------------

Throughout all the ups and downs of FOMO, I’ve learned one key lesson: FOMO is sometimes inevitable. It’s more important to learn how to deal with it healthily and effectively. Being self-aware enough to step back and look at the big picture is critical to maintaining a good mental state throughout this rollercoaster of a ride. Getting caught up in FOMO can make you forget the reason why it’s best for you to be in the situation you’re in right now.

**When you fear missing out on something else, you miss out on what you’re lucky enough to experience right now.**
