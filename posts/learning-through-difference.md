I enjoy playing tennis.

Wait. Calix enjoys things other than tech, business, and entrepreneurship? Absolutely.

Recently, I’ve started playing tennis with a new friend. To keep him anonymous, we’ll call him Sam.

I used to play tennis competitively on the national level, and now I play recreationally. Even though I’ve spent a lot of time playing tennis in my life, I’ve never really resonated with other competitive tennis players. They only talk about tennis, nothing else, which gets kinda old after a few hours. It’s no offense to them, just my personal opinion.

Sam is one of these people.

He’s around 3 years older than me, and he loves tennis. All he does is play tennis and focus on school. And if I’m being honest, on first impression, he’s not someone I would consider to be super academic or career-oriented. Just by the way he talked, thought, and carried himself, I assumed he was just an average college student looking to enjoy life.

But I was wrong. He’s a super avid student who cares a lot about the grades that he gets and the future of his academic path.

When talking to him, I decided to try something new.

In tennis, you take breaks multiple times within the match. On average, around 9-10 times. 

Sam didn’t know anything about what I did outside of tennis. All he knew was that I used to play national-level tennis and that I did “a little bit of programming” on the side. I tell that to everyone.

I decided to take this as an opportunity to learn more about Sam as a person, and what kind of mindset he lived by.

All I did was ask him questions, and it was pretty interesting to hear what he said.

Me: “Where are you going to college?”

Sam: “UC Riverside. Graduating 2024 with a double major in bio-engineering and statistics.”

Me: “That’s cool. Why those majors specifically?”

Sam: “I don’t know, I’m pretty interested in biology, and statistics is a useful skill to have in general.”

Me: “What are you planning to do after undergrad?”

Sam: “I’m going to try to get an MBA.”

Me: “Why do you want to get an MBA?”

Sam: “I want to start a business. I don’t want to ever get a 9-5 job.”

Me: “Why do you need an MBA to start a business?”

Sam: “Because you need an MBA to start a business. Duh.”

----

If I’m being honest, I’m in the same boat. I don’t want to work a 9-5 job for a large portion of my life - I want to run businesses and build startups. 

I think that this shows that in most cases, going through the regular school system in an environment that may not be super driven provides misconceptions. You definitely don’t need an MBA to start a business. In fact, most of the founders I know don’t have MBAs, and those who do don’t even run businesses.

----

But moving on, I decided to change the topic:

Me: “How are your final exams going?”

Sam: “Pretty good. I need a 93% in statistics, a 97% in biology, etc.”

Me: “Why do you need those scores?”


Sam: “So I can get an A in all of those classes.”

Me: “Why do you need an A? Isn’t an A- okay as well?”

Sam: “Nope. An A- equates to a 3.7 GPA. I want a 4.0 GPA”

Me: “Why do you want a 4.0 GPA?”

Sam: I want to get Suma Cum Laude.”

Me: “Oh that’s awesome. Why do you want Suma Cum Laude.”

Sam: shrugs “I don’t know. Bragging rights?”

Me: “Is that the only reason? Does it help with getting a job or graduate school?”

Sam: “Nope. It’s literally useless.”

Me: “But if it’s useless, why do you want it?”

Sam: “I don’t know to be honest. But I want it.”

----

I’ve always been raised with the idea that you don’t do something unless there’s a goal/meaning behind it. Whether it’s because you’re forced to do something, or you have a passion to do something, there should always be a reason why you do it.

Even the fact that he didn’t want such a high-achieving academic award for future academic opportunities like graduate school was surprising to me. 

Then the focus shifted towards me.

-----

Sam: “So what are you up to?”

Me: “Just finishing up my last few assignments for the school year.”

Sam: “Are you taking any AP classes?”

Me: “Nope.”

Sam: “What did you get on the SAT/ACT?”

Me: “Didn’t take it.”

Sam: “Where do you want to go to college?”

Me: “Maybe Stanford or UCLA?”

Sam (in a pitiful voice): “Those schools are really competitive you know?”

Judging without full context. He’s not the only one at fault, we’ve all done this before. 

I didn’t find this offensive. It was actually kind of interesting. It makes you think if you could’ve been ranting about a problem to someone, but if you only knew more about them and their background, they could’ve been the one person to provide a solution for you.

So, why did I even write this blog post? It’s just a bunch of small lessons learned from a random conversation. But, I think the true lesson here isn’t from the dialogue, but from the general scenario.

**We all can learn something from anyone.** It doesn’t matter if you’re talking to a billionaire or a toddler - everyone has different perspectives and experiences that we can learn from. Whether it’s directly or indirectly, listening to what other people have to say and what their opinions are can help us expand our own knowledge.

For example, I was able to indirectly learn from Sam what kind of opinions a normal student who’s gone 12 years of public education has. I’ve been sheltered in an online homeschooling program since I was in 6th grade with parents who’ve encouraged me to learn and try new things.

**Different lives can give different perspectives.**
