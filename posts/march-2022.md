------------------

Hello there! Good to see you again. The first 3 months of 2022 have officially passed, but Iâ€™ve been in so many meetings lately, that all I can comprehend is that Q2 is now starting.

March was a very special month for me. The first two months of this year have been long. My days were filled with work that only brought results through consistency. I spent most of my time alone, continuing to maintain my habits and make progress on my personal and professional work. March was truly a rollercoaster - Iâ€™ll show you why.

Just like previous months, I was happy to spend a weekend at UC Berkeley. Though I wished I couldâ€™ve visited more, it was so nice to see all my friends and attend a few events. I snuck into a student social between Berkeley MET and Berkeley GMP and got into the group photo with everyone LOL. I also attended a Berkeley social hosted by Dropout DAO and Balance.io, getting to meet some cool people in startups and crypto. Beyond the late-night adventures and study sessions around campus, I was able to take some time away from friends to explore the city and campus with some of the most beautiful views.

Around the middle of March, I was lucky enough to spend a week in Downtown San Jose for a Fiveable leadership retreat. Before the retreat even started, I decided to arrive early and explore the city on my skateboard. I visited San Jose State University and enjoyed the beautiful campus. I skateboarded around campus, I walked into student buildings, got work done in various libraries, and also ate lunch in their communal area. In the middle of a meeting, I had to evacuate one of the libraries I was working in due to a fire alarm, and had to carry my skateboard down 7 flights of stairs.

Beyond SJSU, I toured a cool interactive tech museum and checked out some interesting monuments. They hosted some really cool humanistic statues, AR/VR experiences, and even a space station simulation game. 

During the retreat, we spent a lot of time inside our coworking space having hard, thoughtful discussions. With so many leadership members living outside of the Bay Area, we were eager to try out new restaurants. We ate Japanese BBQ, traditional German cuisine, Mediterranean food, and also at an indigenous Mexican restaurant. And no offense, but the food and service at the German restaurant was pretty bad ðŸ’€

All throughout this month, I went through a phase of life that many dread: college decisions. Flashing back to December 2021, I had my dreams crushed when I was rejected from Stanford, and dedicated myself to working extremely hard on my upcoming college applications to ensure that they went well. Did they? Letâ€™s find out.

Being accepted into a good university meant a lot to me, though Iâ€™m in a comfortable position to continue my career without higher education. Finding community in a school of high-caliber individuals and being proud of my schoolâ€™s prestige were important to me, so I took a huge risk and applied to a heavy amount of reach schools, and not many target or safety schools. My plan was to take an independent gap year if I didnâ€™t receive an offer I was happy with and work full-time. Though it was a solid plan on paper, deep down, I was extremely anxious. I didnâ€™t want to take a gap year.

The decisions started coming in at the beginning of March. I started my decision season by getting rejected from the University of Washington (56% acceptance). I was also rejected from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (38.4% acceptance) and Cal Poly Pomona (64.8% acceptance), schools that my parents graduated from and my sister was accepted into. I wasnâ€™t off to a good start. I was luckily accepted by San Jose State University (67.4% acceptance), UC Merced (84.8% acceptance), and UC Riverside (65.8% acceptance), all good fallback schools but not offers I was particularly proud to adopt. Going further, I was rejected from UC Davis (46.4% acceptance), UC Irvine (29.9% acceptance), UCLA (14.8% acceptance), UC San Diego (36.6% acceptance), UC Santa Barbara (36.7% acceptance), and UC Berkeley (14.5% acceptance). I was also waitlisted at UC Santa Cruz (64.7% acceptance). I also got rejected from Babson College (27% acceptance), an entrepreneurship school, and Harvey Mudd College (18% acceptance). At that point, I was completely demoralized. Though I had some hope in upcoming private university admissions, my morale had sunk through the floor, and it affected my day-to-day mood and thoughts. 

A few days passed, and I received an admission decision from USC. This was a school that I wanted to attend for so many reasons, but I obviously wasnâ€™t confident. After procrastinating for hours and a little encouragement, I opened the decision letter. I was accepted into USCâ€™s Iovine & Young Academy. Absolutely in shock. I found myself celebrating the same way I had seen it on college reaction YouTube videos. It was the last thing I couldâ€™ve possibly expected, and it was one of the happiest moments of my entire life. 

Moving forward, the decisions didnâ€™t get better. But it was okay. I was rejected from Northwestern University (9.3% acceptance), University of Michigan (26.1% acceptance), Boston University (20.1% acceptance), Vanderbilt University (11.6% acceptance), Tufts University (16.3% acceptance), and Syracuse University (68.7% acceptance). I was surprisingly waitlisted at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s CS program (7% acceptance), and also at NYU (21.1% acceptance). Finally, with Ivy League Day being today, March 31, I was rejected from Brown University (7.7% acceptance), Cornell University (10.7% acceptance), Harvard (5% acceptance), and University of Pennsylvania (9% acceptance). 

In total, I applied to 28 colleges, where I was accepted into 4 schools (3 of which were safety schools), and rejected from 21 schools. Though on paper itâ€™s a below average performance, I feel so grateful for the results I received. I made the amazing decision to record all of my college reactions, and will be spending time these next few days editing together a video of all of them. It may not be YouTube worthy, but theyâ€™re moments that Iâ€™d be ecstatic to show my family and future self.

Overall, I did a lot of miscellaneous things this month as well. I served at my church quite often, I attended a few family dinners in Concord and San Francisco, I worked hard on personal projects, and most importantly, I finished my last high school assignment of my high school career. On weekends and weekdays where I had more free time than usual, I worked hard on finishing my classes early. I recently received my final grades for the semester, finishing with a 3.87 GPA out of 5 classes, and reaching full completion almost 3 months before my original end date. Though I thought Iâ€™d be an easy candidate for heavy senioritis, Iâ€™m happy that I didnâ€™t fall into that rut.

---------------------------

March has encapsulated some of the best and worst times of my life. I went through extreme highs, and extreme lows. I had some of the best days of my life, and some days where everything was falling apart. I visited new places, I met new people, and I spent time with friends and loved ones. I fought with imposter syndrome, FOMO, and low self-esteem. I reached new milestones, achieved new goals, and experienced once-in-a-lifetime moments. Through the ups and downs of a high school senior and a kid figuring out his career, Iâ€™m proud that I endured through everything this month and came out of it with a positive outlook.

I feel so grateful. Iâ€™m so thankful that I attend the school that I do. Though itâ€™s not a prestigious school that focuses on setting students up for success in higher education or their career, itâ€™s given me the flexibility to pursue my passions and complete work at my own pace. Iâ€™m thankful for everyone who supported me through college applications: my parents, my friends, my counselor, etc. Iâ€™m thankful that I was lucky enough to receive an admission offer from one of my dream programs. Iâ€™m thankful for my friends and my company for all the fun experiences, memories, and moments that I will never forget.
