I know a lot of people. Maybe not super closely, but in the last year, I’ve been able to see many other founders, engineers, and entrepreneurs while expanding my network and presence in various online communities and niches.

With knowing a lot of people, I’ve met some really great people. They work hard, treat people well, and are truthful in all that they say and do.

And… there’s some people that just aren’t so great. They don’t work hard, they manipulate people, they stab others in the back, and they just act fake in many scenarios to get what they want.

I definitely have someone in mind when I describe the not-so-great people. In fact, there’s multiple. But, I’m not here to call anyone out or write a hate post, so the name of one person that stands out will stay anonymous. We’ll call him Fred.

Who is Fred? Fred is very young (around 12-13 years old), he is an “engineer”, an “entrepreneur”, and a person who strives to be successful. There’s nothing wrong with striving for success, as long as you do it ethically.

**Here’s the story of Fred.**

## The Notice

I first heard about Fred through the amazing Hack Club community. Anyone who’s been there for some time knows exactly who Fred is.

Hack Club’s community is one of the best online communities out there for young people. It’s full of bright engineers with great moderation and a big sense of community. To preserve quality, they have a strict “no self-promotion” rule. Pretty reasonable, right?

Fred did not care. He broke that rule at least 3-4 times. 

He joined a fake sales internship and tried to sell his company’s product to other Hack Club students as a part of an unknown pyramid scheme. 

He organized a hackathon and promoted it multiple times within the community, as well as many others. 

Heck, once he even promoted his own Twitter and told people to follow him until he got banned from the community.

## The Pitch

Months go by. I’m less active in Hack Club because of my other commitments. I don’t see Fred anywhere, until now.

I get a DM. “Hey!” It’s from Fred.

I reply and ask him what’s up.

“Hey Calix, would love to have you as the CTO of my company!”

I’ve heard this proposition many times before. He somehow convinced me to jump on a call right then and there. I had 30 minutes to spare so I figured, why not.

I joined the call, meeting him for the first time. 

To describe him bluntly, he sounded like a young kid trying to act like an adult. His dialogue did not match his tone - he was saying irrelevant things with the most confident tone I’ve ever heard.

He tried to convince me to become his CTO, and took up 2 hours of my time just trying to do so. It was one of the wildest ideas I’ve heard in a while in edtech in terms of distribution, and though they had some interest and hopes in receiving some capital from angels and VCs, it just seemed way out of their reach.

Not only this, but he also was applying to become an engineer at a company I co-founded and manage, Bitperks. And all I could think was, you want me to work for you, and at the same time you want to work for me?
I politely dropped the CTO offer, and rejected him immediately after his interview after hearing some BS answers to my questions. I had bad first impressions, and I had bad real impressions at this point.

## The Expose

This is where things get spicy 🔥

I got a Discord message from a past engineer I had interviewed for Bitperks. It was a link to a website purely dedicated to exposing Fred.

Though it would’ve been easier to copy-paste the link here, that would expose who Fred was. Instead, I’ll explain every single main point of that website.

**NOTE: All of this content is paraphrased straight from the exposing website, not me.**

### Fraudulent Behavior

As I expected, Fred had said a lot of things about himself that simply weren’t true.

#### Programming

Fred cannot code. His personal website is a direct copy from another Twitter-famous engineer with no traces of credit given. He doesn’t understand how to use half of the technologies he claims to know and fakes all of his coding-related contributions on GitHub.

#### Scamming

Fred had been publicly claiming capabilities and skills that he didn’t actually have to attract investors and partners to him. When asked by colleagues to take this false information down, he refused, saying it would detract all of his leads with VCs and business partners.

#### Resume

Fred had also claimed past experiences that he didn’t have. He listed that he co-founded 2 companies, one of which doesn’t exist and the other he had no affiliation with, as confirmed by the actual founder and CEO, as well as small things like speaking French, which he doesn’t understand.

### Wrongdoing

Fred had been affecting others not just in the things he’s said, but the things he’s done.

#### Doxxing and Stalking

Fred had apparently leaked his school class’s Zoom links for a reason I’m not aware of, and a classmate wanted to rat him out. Fred ended up blackmailing this classmate, saying that if he ratted him out he would contact their parents, as well as claiming that he found their parents' info through stalking them.

#### IP Grabbing and DDoSing

Fred had allegedly been caught using an illegal DDoSing website tool that can be used to take down anyone’s internet connection, as well as those around them, just from knowing their computer IP address. He attempted IP grabbing on his teammates, but got caught.

#### Raiding

It all comes back to Hack Club. After getting banned from the community, Fred created plans to raid the community once again by flooding the community with spam bots and profanity. Though there are many screenshots to prove this, I again will not disclose who Fred is.

#### Slander

Fred also had a brief history of slandering and spreading rumors about those he disliked and had beef with. Screenshots prove that he went as far as impersonating a user on his own website to report to his team about the poor performance and manners of a teammate of his.

So, there you have it. In a nutshell, I have completely exposed Fred. But why?

I want to make it clear that this is not a hate post against Fred. Though I don’t like Fred, I don’t hate him. I wouldn’t go out of my way to humiliate or shame him - I wouldn't do that for anyone. But, I saw a valuable lesson in this story, and I wanted to share:

**Just be a good person.**

Achieving success and doing great things is about you, not the people around you. Putting people down will never work out in the long run. Almost all successful people have achieved great things because of the people around them - no one has ever made a billion dollars through backstabbing their way to the top. And if someone has, I’m sure they’re miserable because no one likes them.

In Fred’s case, he lost almost everything in the end. All 30 of the engineers at his company left, along with the work they’d contributed. His co-founders are nowhere to be found, and I’m sure all of the business development he’d been working on has shattered.

**Treat others well, and they will treat you well back.**
