“What should I do with my career? How do I know I’m on the right path?”

I’ve been asked these questions a thousand times, with the expectation that I can actually give them a single answer.

It’s impossible for someone else to answer that question for you. It’s something that you need to figure out for yourself. But, that doesn’t mean there can’t be a framework for helping you determine what the best career path for you is. It all comes from a simple rule:

**Great careers come from great interests.**

Though it’s true that many “booming” fields are very lucrative with a bright and prosperous future, any “interest” that is powered by materialistic desires will always die out at the first encounter with adversity. We can’t power our career paths with shallow values if we want to have longevity in mind.

For me, my journey in SWE started from a point of pure interest. Both my parents have a strong background in computer science, but have never forced me into the field. I got my start through ethical hacking and penetration testing. I had no understanding of how high the salaries of software engineers were, or how much technology was revolutionizing the future - **it was just fun.** Hijacking webcams, installing keyloggers, and tinkering with little scripts filled my days and thoughts, and my pivot into actual programming was only initiated when a new interest in building was sparked inside of me.

I try to use my experiences to influence others at the beginner level. Many great pioneers in their respective fields start their journeys from intrinsic interest to notable mastery, and I think that this repeating pattern is one that many can learn from. Peer pressure and short-term desires can offset your judgement, and if your motivation for the work that you do is extrinsic, it will quickly fade as soon as your expectations are met or out of reach.

In summary? Find your career interests, pick the most promising one, and give it a try. Don’t let outside influences cloud your judgement, just stay genuine. If it doesn’t work out, try again. Not every attempt you make will reap the benefits you seek, but there’s never any reason to not try again.

**If we want to have a successful and fulfilling career path, we need to invest our time into things that make us genuinely interested and content.**
