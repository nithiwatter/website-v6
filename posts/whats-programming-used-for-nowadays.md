“Programming is cool, but I’m more interested in \[insert different field here\]. Should I still get into it?”

Time and time again, teachers, grandparents, parents, and others have been famous for dispelling the use of technology. But what most people fail to realize is the prevalence of technology in our lives. Even if you don’t personally know how to code or do so much as navigate a website without assistance, software is everywhere. Nowadays, there are barely any fields that don’t include some type of software or technology for enhancement.

And to prove it...

## IT/Computer Science
This one is pretty obvious. This field does not incorporate programming; it is programming. Computer science and information technology are quite literally the field of programming software to create specified results, whether that is in the form of an online program, a hardware function, or something else entirely.

## Scientific Research/Experimentation
Within this field, there are several instances in which programming is helpful. This is typically concentrated in two areas: experimental devices and result analysis. Most devices used today are a form of hardware, and hardware cannot exist without software (essentially programming). In aeronautical science, each individual function of a Mars Rover works because of a pre-programmed sequence describing how the device should respond to each external stimulus. In radiological sciences, the fission and fusion is not done by hand or even hand-operated devices. The human- induced error would be gargantuan! Each device is programmed to release electrons at a certain time and with a certain angle, in a precise manner. On the analysis side, programming can take large quantities of numerical data and instantly graph or plug them into a series of equations. Anyone who has worked with an excel sheet has certainly witnessed that technological magic.

## Math
Although programming is applicable in many areas of mathematics, as coding itself is a mathematical process, the largest element of programming within math is calculators! Calculators are tiny boxes of mathematical code. The original computers were calculators, hence the name.  

## Health/Medical Field
Similar to the scientific research area, most devices and result analyses use some form of programming. Life support is programmed. The medicine dosage rates on IVs are programmed. Pacemakers are programmed. Surgical devices, as aforementioned, are programmed. MRI machines are programmed. The blood pressure analyzers, thermometers, and pulse oximeters used across doctors offices, school nurse offices, and households all use programming. Similarly, each piece of data collected in doctors’ offices is entered in online databases, which, guess what, are programmed!

## Economics/Business
The corporate world is littered with programming. Almost every financial speculation is based on code; the entire field is numbers. However, the greatest case of programming within economics is the stock market itself. The stocks app on your phone is programmed, tracking stock fluctuations outside of that handy app is based in programming, and even buying and selling stocks themselves is a largely programmed interaction. Plus, no one can forget advertising, a staple of the corporate world. There are algorithms that use search histories and (although not proven in most cases) keywords extrapolated from the data picked up by your phone microphone to tailor ads specifically to you.

## Manufacturing
As of the industrial revolution, the manufacturing process, as I’m sure you all know, has become increasingly mechanized. The machinery that builds plastic utensils, crafts car parts, and even makes some of the ready-made-meals you can find in the grocery store are computer-based and hence, programmed.

## Government/Policy
Streaming that presidential debate, the Google search to find Trump’s latest tweet, completing the census on a laptop or phone, and that petition you clicked “sign” on at Change.org are all examples of how programming is used in the political field. Additionally, resources are distributed online, candidates build their own websites to further their campaigns, etc.

## Education
The programming of Edtech sites such as Khan Academy and Quizlet have revolutionized education. Before programming, no class would have been able to hold Kahoots or Quizlet Lives while children screamed “faster” at their partners and claimed misclicks on the day before a big test. Similarly, online grading systems have changed the field. Imagine waiting till the end of the quarter or semester to see your final grades as opposed to the minute by minute updates present in contemporary education. Teacher and school websites, too, have caused a drastically new approach to the entire system.

## Physical Art
While the production of physical, not digital, art is still technology-free (although I’m sure there are instances…), artists have begun programming websites to share their art with the world. Art shows and competitions transitioning online have allowed a greater audience and wider economic outreach for artists, as well.

## Writing/Journalism
Magazines and newspapers converting themselves into online entities has not only saved the trees, but increased the outreach of news. Additionally, youth have received opportunities to program their own websites for their own journals, magazines, or newspapers, granting experiences and an influx of future opportunities. People have also been able to create careers out of blogging or “vlogging,” such that Youtube and Tik Tok are careers rather than hobbies.

## Sports
Despite what many may think, the athletic industry is one of the most programmed of all. The score boards are constantly being programmed and reprogrammed to reflect player/team statistics, respond to penalties or score changes, depict advertisements or player histories, and have a constantly draining and halting clock. In addition to these, the infatuation with statistics and charting almost every movement a player makes uses a great deal of programming. Even still, sports marketing is a growing field. The industry is pretty much made up of teams, programmers, and the occasional broadcaster.

## Fashion/Beauty
This industry, although not the typical programmer’s avenue, is far from left out of the hype. Entire apps and websites have been constructed surrounding matching outfits, makeup tutorials, and skin care regimens. Programming has allowed for sites in which you can “shop” and ‘try on” clothing online through uploading pictures and some bodily statistics. Like other industries also, websites, blogs, etc. have transformed the industry.

No matter if you identify as a traditional techy, a novice in the world of programming, or even just wondering if you should get into it, programming holds a significant role in society, and it’s definitely worth learning for people in any field.
