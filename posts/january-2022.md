------------------

Hello! Before I start, Iâ€™m excited to say that I will start writing reflection blogs like the one youâ€™re reading right now every month. These reflections are meant for me to look back on everything that happened in the recent month, think about what Iâ€™ve accomplished and failed at, and put out my updates for others to read. This was inspired by my good friend [Ellen](https://xuellen.com/), so shout out to her!

## Personal updates

So far this year, a big focus of mine was on personal development. Not through deprioritizing professional goals, but rather optimizing my free time each day towards personal development.

A big new skill I learned this month was how to skateboard! Around mid-January I got hooked on getting an electric skateboard, and I saw it as a good challenge to get myself away from the desk and learn new skills. I wonâ€™t tell the whole story now because Iâ€™ll probably write a blog post about it soon, but letâ€™s just say it was a success ðŸ˜‰

**UPDATE:** Read the full skateboarding story [here](https://calix.dev/blog/skateboarding).

Another goal for myself was to explore more and spend more time outside. Whether Iâ€™m working, eating, or sleeping, Iâ€™m always at home. One of my comfort zones is staying at home, so Iâ€™ve been doing my best to break it through challenging my lack of spontaneity and exploration. I met up with a handful of friends for lunch/dinner throughout the month, relocated myself to work in coffee shops a few times a week, and have purposely gone out of my way to explore various cities, areas, and parks around me. I even spent a night at UC Berkeley with all of my friends and it was one of the best experiences of this month.

On the academic side, I was able to finish my school semester 10 weeks early, so Iâ€™ve been going through January without any schoolwork whatsoever. I also finished all my college applications and completed my college interviews with Babson College and Northwestern University.

Finally, Iâ€™ve been aiming to become increasingly more self-aware. Specifically, Iâ€™ve been trying to monitor my energy levels during phases of unproductivity and creating ways to combat it efficiently. As I mentioned in a [previous blog post on procrastination](https://calix.dev/blog/procrastination), I sometimes go through cycles of hyperfocus and then burnout, which usually results in hours of scrolling and YouTube binge watching. So when I become tired, Iâ€™ve been trying small things like playing an exercise-centric video game, riding my electric skateboard around my neighborhood, or changing my work environment to relax my mind a little bit. So far, itâ€™s been pretty helpful, and I think Iâ€™m continually getting better and better.

## Professional updates

Professional development this month was a bit of a rollercoaster. I was strongly fueled by disappointment from early action college rejections in December and determined to improve myself from a career standpoint.

First off, I joined the On Deck Edtech (ODET2) fellowship mid-January and we officially kicked off our 2nd cohort. My fellow fellows are all world-class Edtech operators and investors hailing from Coursera, 2U, and Skillshare, and itâ€™s mind-boggling. One of my fellow cohort members even used to be a middle school principal.

On the topic of Edtech, this month I published 2 articles on [Edtech Insiders](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/). I never formally announced that I became a guest contributor to this publication, but I started around mid-December and have been loving it ever since. I published an article about [apprenticeships as a work training strategy](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/guest-post-are-apprenticeships-the) and also one about [premium course platform providers](https://edtechinsiders.substack.com/p/how-do-premium-course-platforms-differ). Iâ€™ve also been working on a super exciting article about the implementation of VR and immersive experiences in education, and itâ€™s just about ready to publish ðŸ‘€

This month has also allowed me to get back into writing personal blog posts. I had to take such a long break from writing these blog posts last year because of college applications because it was creatively challenging to write these posts alongside college essays. With college applications out of the way, it felt like the perfect opportunity to continue creating personally-fulfilling content for others to read. In fact, this is the third day in a row Iâ€™ve written and published a blog post, and I hope to keep up the pace into February.

Finally, as of January 31, Fiveable has officially adopted Hours as its new core platform and vision for the foreseeable future by launching our newly redesigned platform! This pivot will allow us as a company to be more streamlined in our internal operations, feature development, and resource allocation. You can read more about this story in [my last blog post](https://calix.dev/blog/hours-is-now-fiveable).

Overall, this actually isnâ€™t everything that Iâ€™ve been up to this month regarding my professional career. Iâ€™ve been working on a lot of stuff behind the scenes that will be kept secret for now, but hopefully it will all be announced soon.

-------------------------------

Thinking back to when 2022 started, I remember being super scared. Whenever the new year hits, I always find myself worrying about time. 12 months seems so short and 365 days feels like it can pass by in the blink of an eye. With January done and the year being 1/12 over, time feels like itâ€™s flying.

One thing Iâ€™m extremely proud of is living with no clear direction. I used to be a control freak, always planning everything out and ensuring that I know where Iâ€™m going. In these last few months, especially January, Iâ€™ve been traveling through life without any particular long-term goals or direction. I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life or what a desirable career path looks like. The only rule Iâ€™ve set upon myself is to ensure that I take each day to work hard on something, and make sure Iâ€™m constantly making some sort of personal and professional development. That way, I know Iâ€™m making progress even if I donâ€™t know where the path ends.
