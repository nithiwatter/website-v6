------------------

Welcome back to my life! This past month has felt very monumental, just like in March. My time in April was filled with many milestones and long-awaited experiences. Whenever anyone’s been asking me what I’ve been up to, I just respond, “I’ve just been doing high school things.”

Despite all these amazing experiences, April felt extremely short and short-lived. I’ll explain later…

At the very start of the month, I attended prom. I attended a different school’s prom, where I barely knew anyone other than my girlfriend. Even though the actual event started at 6pm, we were busy taking photos and driving around for 8 hours beforehand. It was held at the San Jose Civic Center, a way too extravagant venue to hold a high school prom, but the tickets were $200 each so I wasn’t complaining.

Everything about it was perfect. The dancing, the music, the people I met, the moments that were captured. It was such a surreal experience, not just because it was so fun, but because I never thought I’d be able to experience something like that. Back when I was still a freshman, I had already been homeschooled for 4 years, and I was feeling extremely lonely. I knew that committing to this path meant that I would miss out on a lot: friends, parties, and those special events like prom. Fast-forward to today, and I finally got to collect those memories that I never thought I’d have.

Later that week, I embarked on a trip to USC. On the first day, I attended an IYA-specific event where I met most of my ~30 other cohort members, toured the building, talked with faculty, got a glimpse into the classes, etc. I can still remember walking up the main staircase with the words “The Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy” engraved on it - probably the most epic stairs I’ve ever walked on. Everything about it just made me fall in love with the school even more. I knew better and better that it was the place I wanted to spend the next phase of my life.

The day after, I attended the admitted students day for all USC admits. It was much larger with about ~5000 attendees. What was funny was we were instructed to break into groups for the schools we were attending, so we hung out as the IYA again for the second day. I got to spend more time touring the campus, meeting current students, and just realizing how beautiful the campus itself was. I was super sad to leave, but I knew I would be back again soon. Right when I got home, I submitted my official commitment to USC.

I also got to spend another weekend at UC Berkeley again this month. More the same, and yet every time I visit it’s a new experience. I did everything I possibly could. I lounged around the dorm and I explored more of campus. I saw sunsets from the city and I saw sunsets from the roof. I caught up with old friends and I made new friends. I indulged in dining hall food and I tried new restaurants. With the semester coming to a close for many students, it may have been my last visit for the next few months.

Another milestone: I graduated high school. Yes, my graduation ceremony will be in mid-June, but I officially finished all my classes, received my final transcripts, and closed out my high school journey. It was weird to think that I’m currently not a student, and I won’t be for another few months. Right from the beginning to end, high school was a period of my life where I had the most growth, personally and career-wise. I’ll forever remember these years.

So, why did this month feel short? Welp, I’ve been sick for the past two weeks. Right after I came back from Berkeley, I started feeling sick. Two COVID tests showed I was negative, but I was still forced to stay home and only go outside in secluded areas. I couldn’t celebrate my graduation because I was illl, and I felt hindered from doing a lot of things I wanted to do before college like meeting up with friends and exploring new places. Though I’m luckily recovering, I’m still sick as I write this. I honestly didn’t expect to be sick for this long.

While being sick, I couldn’t really do much to cope. It was hard to go places, focus on work, or have the energy to do much of anything. At some point, my thoughts started to take over, and I needed to get out of the house. I started going on walks and skateboard rides, and I let spontaneity lead the way. One time, I was just skateboarding around my area when I saw a hiking trail entrance and thought, “It’s almost sunset. What if I just hiked to the top of this hill?”. Another time, I discovered a newly-constructed neighborhood of mansions on the top of an extremely steep, dangerous hill. Did I decide to hike to the very top even though I was sick? Yes. Did I almost slip and fall several times? Absolutely. Did I slow down my recovery by unintentionally exercising so much? Probably. But, I don’t regret it a single bit.

--------------------

Overall, this month didn’t feel like a month, rather it felt like half. While reflecting, I realized that I didn’t create as many memories as I had hoped for April. It was disappointing since that’s the whole reason why I write daily and monthly reflections like these.

Despite that, for the half that felt real, it held some of the best moments of my life. Whether I spent it with family, friends, or alone in my bedroom, it was all worth it in my book.
