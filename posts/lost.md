I don’t like getting lost. It’s filled with uncertainty and generally a waste of time. I could be spending that time working or getting to the destination I was initially heading to in the first place, but instead I’m lost with no idea what to do.

The last few weeks have been feeling like that for me - I’ve been pretty lost in a career-sense. 
With the recent acquisition of Hours, I’ve had a lot more time on my hands. With summer break starting, the only time commitments I have is my position working at Fiveable which is part-time, as well as a fellowship I’m participating in, and neither take up any time on the weekends. 

Though I've been working on a new startup venture that’s still in stealth and private, that kind of huge shift in time management really had a mental impact on me.

Basically, I’ve been feeling very lost. My stealth venture doesn’t show much promise and things just don’t seem to be moving. It’s sucking up quite a bit of my personal capital, and a lot of questions are circling my head about my next steps.

All of this confusion and time alone has created an insane amount of unproductivity. This unproductivity has turned into a lack of fulfillingness. And that has inevitably resulted in me not feeling so great about myself and what I’m doing.

**Relax, this isn’t just a sob story post.**

I think as time has gone on, I’ve realized that it’s okay not to be doing anything solid all the time. It’s okay to just **explore**. Finding new interests and opportunities is the only way you can grow - you can’t grow just by staying where you are and making progress in one place.

In light of this, I’m exploring a new industry that I’ve been interested in for quite a while. I’m expanding my horizon to new fellowships, internships, and opportunities from amazing startups. I’m writing more content on my blog to share my story and save my memories.

At least for me, it’s really easy to miss all of the blessings I’ve been given that’s right in front of my face. I mean, I’ve done things I could’ve only dreamed of a year prior. It’s always good to look to the future with a growth mindset, but we also need to take time to appreciate what we have. It’s selfish to only think of what we want in the future and not appreciate what we’ve been given.

I’ll admit, the main inspiration behind writing this blog post is because I wanted to vent these emotions I’ve been struggling with. Being lost is something that everyone will probably have at some point in their life, and I just hope that my experiences so far can help someone else.

If not, at least it’ll make for good memories to look back on.
