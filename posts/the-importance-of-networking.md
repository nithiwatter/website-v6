Networking is super important. It helps you meet new people, stay connected with good ones, and almost always opens up doors to opportunities you would’ve never gotten without your connections. But nowadays, networking has gotten a weird connotation, and an assumption that it’s only for adults and working professionals. While most of the time this is the case, if we were to drop that stereotype, a lot of young people and students could take advantage of it and boost their career before it even starts.

Now, when I say networking, I don’t automatically mean LinkedIn. There are TONS of other places that people overlook when talking about networking. I’ve networked on LinkedIn, different online communities, in-person networking events, etc. No matter where you do it, networking is networking. Now, I’m not going to talk about **how** to network, but more about **why** you should network, and here’s why:

## 1. You can make lasting connections professionally
This is an obvious one. With networking, quality is better than quantity. And once you focus on quality, you can meet some super amazing and valuable connections! Where you decide to network also makes a difference on what kind of connections you’ll find. Different communities hold different people, and sometimes you’ll meet types of people that you won’t be able to find on places like LinkedIn.

Personally, I’ve met some **amazing** people outside of LinkedIn. For example, communities like Hack Club are filled with amazing software engineers and programmers that are lightyears ahead of me in terms of technical knowledge, and they’re all still around my age! In other networks like TKS, I’ve met some extremely accomplished entrepreneurs and students immersed in topics I can’t even fathom like quantum computing and biomedical research! I’ve met students who’ve had their companies acquired, writing apps that have hundreds of thousands of users, and have special recognition from Forbes, CNN, etc. There are so many places to make new connections even as a high school student, and even more so for those in college.

It’s obviously not just about who you meet, but how you work with them. It’s important to know who would be a valuable addition to your network and who wouldn’t be. I’ve had countless coffee chats and networking calls with people who were super nice and accomplished, but never stayed in touch because I didn’t have time. But, when you do find people that would fit nicely in your network, it’s important to act on it. For example, I met my co-founder for EdTube, [Michael Ye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/realmichaelye/), through a random networking call off of LinkedIn! We stayed in touch and he eventually pitched the idea of EdTube to me after a few calls, and we decided to start working on the idea together at that very moment! But, none of that would’ve happened if we had never stayed in contact.

## 2. Mutual benefits!
This is usually what comes to mind first when the topic of networking is brought up. Why network with people if you can’t benefit from it right? Though I don’t necessarily think that kind of mindset is good, it is worthwhile to point out that mutual benefits from networking with different people is a huge part of it. Different connections can provide you with different opportunities, and you can do the same for them! Networking is usually a good move for both parties, which makes it mutually beneficial! Especially if you decide to network with people in your field/industry of your choice and you’re able to demonstrate your skills and excellence, they might be able to give you a referral to join the company that they may be working at. Even if they don’t refer you to different companies or job positions, they can open up doors to a lot of different opportunities, such as speaking on a podcast, working on a project, or maybe even an event invitation!

Mutual benefits aren’t something that should be the goal of every networking interaction, because more than likely you will be able to benefit from making new connections even if you’re not receiving things like opportunities, referrals, etc. You can learn so many things from just talking with someone else, and learning from their past stories, experiences, and mindset!

## 3. It’s a great experience whether you make good connections or not
You’re not always going to meet valuable connections when networking. It’s like a blind date, you never know if someone is going to be a good fit for you until you talk with them, whether that be in person, over the phone, or in some other way.

I’ve had my fair share of networking calls that didn’t go the way I was hoping, or I wasn’t able to talk to someone that I thought would be a good fit for my network. Even through those calls that may have seemed unproductive to me at the time, I was able to learn something. Maybe not from them directly, but about human behavior in general. I was able to pick up on certain patterns that different people had when I started to have more frequent calls. And, depending on who you are, getting on the phone with someone completely new might be out of your comfort zone, and would therefore be a good challenge for you even if the call goes terribly wrong!

-----------------------

In the end, I think a good mindset to have when networking is that there’s always something to learn from someone. Everyone is better than you in something, and in that way they can teach you about it and you can learn more. Networking has been able to open doors for me that I would’ve never imagined, and I know many others who’ve boosted their entire careers through networking, and just getting to know other people. It really does tie in with the saying “it’s not what you know, but who you know”. In this context, it’s not just a simple, cliche saying - it’s actually true.
