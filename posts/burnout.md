Burnout. What an interesting concept isn’t it?

You hear about it all over social media. People tell you about it. Sometimes you even feel burnt out. There’s so much info everywhere that I’m not gonna write about what burnout is, or what steps you should take to fix it. I just want to share my personal experience with it, and how I’ve dealt with it.

I’ve experienced a lot of burnout. I work on different projects, startups, and internships for around 12-15 hours every day, including weekends. I never take days where I don’t work at all; those days are called vacations, and it’s only possible when I’m not allowed within a 5-mile radius of my laptop.

With a lot of constant work comes burnout, and my burnout comes in cycles. Maybe I’d have 1-2 weeks of solid, consistent work, and then hit a point of burnout after that amount of time. After I’ve dealt with it, the cycle just repeats. Now, I’ve never taken a class or read an article about how to deal with burnout and fully understood it because, frankly, I suck at reading, and I also don’t know if this “cycle” is considered healthy. But, what I do know is that dealing with burnout is really not that complex.

**So Calix, if it’s not that complex, then how do you deal with burnout?**

It’s easy. **You rest. You take breaks.** But, you need to be able to rest properly.

I know what you’re thinking: “Calix, that’s the most idiotic statement I’ve ever heard. How does someone rest properly??”

**And like any engineer, I have to say it depends.**

What does it depend on? Well, everyone’s different. And you can’t trust every article you see online on “how to fix burnout” to give you the answer. But, the short answer is that you need to do what you enjoy, **but it must be unrelated to your work.**

For me, I’m one of those people that some could call a workaholic. If I’m not working, I’m thinking about my work. I’m ideating different strategies when I’m away from a computer. I’m writing down notes and new ideas on my phone. I’m always thinking about it.

So, taking a “spa day” or a “self-care day” isn’t gonna help me at all. I’m not the type to sit down and read a book, or just chill on the couch for fun. I do things that occupy my mind, but aren’t necessarily challenging me.

But, I love playing tennis. As not many people know, I used to play competitive tennis around the national level. Though I stopped playing competitively years ago, I still enjoy going out to the courts a couple times a week to play with friends and family. It’s enjoyable because my level skill has not diminished, and I can play with peace of mind without that competitive edge. It’s a great way for me to relax, take my mind off of work, and sharpen my focus towards something good for my mind and body.

Tennis is a great way for me to relax, but for others, it may be different.

My advice to you? **Find what you enjoy the most that’s completely unrelated to your work, and go do that.**

Enjoy knitting? Knit something. Basketball? Go shoot some hoops. Rest doesn’t always mean relaxing your body, but relaxing your mind. Take your mind off of your work, so that you can truly take a break and come back refreshed.

At the end of the day, burnout is inevitable, and not always a bad thing. Burnout is a sign that you’re trying and working hard; those who don’t push themselves and strive to become better every day will never burn out of their work. Allow it to shift your perspective as a reminder to enjoy things outside of work, and to take care of yourself. You don’t need to dedicate an entire day for “self-care,” just rest and enjoy your hobbies every day.
