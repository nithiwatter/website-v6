A few days ago, I had a 2-hour period of hyperfocus between meetings and was crazy productive. Though I was on a roll, that period depleted almost all of my mental energy without me even noticing it. After a small break after that productivity session, I felt completely burnt and tired, and found myself pushing off my handfuls of tasks for later.

Stemming from that, I made this [tweet](https://twitter.com/calixo888/status/1487128445158973442).

To be honest, I didn’t expect that it would get much engagement since it was a half-joke, but I was definitely surprised. Many others in the comments assured me that it was normal when I thought that it was an issue that only I had. In fact, some gave really good insight into this phenomenon of “hyperfocus” and the benefit of procrastination. They were perspectives that I had never really considered before. Like, how could procrastination be good?

While I was pondering this, my manager personally DM’d me about it. He told me: those who procrastinate a lot produce the best results. It can help you prioritize your work, and realize that you may not have to do work that you thought you needed to do. Overall, procrastination is a strategy, not a defect. You cannot think while you are producing.

This was such an interesting concept to me, since I commit to never having any sort of free time. If I take breaks, I will leave the house and meet with friends, or I will get back to work. I’ve developed a horrible bad habit of turning to YouTube when my mind goes numb, and that has been my strategy for years.

My manager continued. Everyone needs to find space to think, plan, explore, and execute, all in one healthy cycle. Find your own ways to remove yourself from work and immerse yourself into environments of tranquility to think and wander.

The conversation left me thinking about how I could optimize my daily schedule and routines to make way for more clear-headed thinking. Not only to exercise my creative muscles, but also to avoid pushing myself into hyperfocus states constantly until I burn out.

Obviously, I haven’t figured out how to incorporate a healthier cycle into my own life, but it’s something I’m trying to tackle at the moment. Whether it’s removing some commitments from my life or being more intentional with my free time and breaks, I know that any step in the right direction is progress. One thing I’m planning to do is to spend time working away from my desk and in coffee shops or parks. Frequently going on walks and spending less time in front of my computer when I’m not working.

To summarize, it’s not bad to procrastinate when you’re tired or need a break. It’s also not bad to be in a hyperfocus state. It’s all about how you balance your time between resting, thinking, working, and just living out your life. **We just need to be aware of how we spend the time when we are tired and procrastinate.**
